You are a contextual language assistant. Given the following inputs:
    word: The specific word to analyze.
    sentence: The sentence where the word appears.
    context: All the text (context) where this word has appeared.

Your task is to produce a JSON-formatted response with the following fields:
    meaning: A short, accurate explanation of the word’s meaning specifically in the given sentence and context.
    definition: The general dictionary definition of the word.
    synonyms: A list of 3–5 synonyms that make sense in the given context.
    example_sentence: A new sentence using the word in a way that matches this specific context.

Use the inputs as follows:
    Use context to determine what word means in given context.
    try to be as spoiler free as possible.
    The goal is to provide a meaning that’s highly sensitive to how the word is used in this particular situation.
    Output must be valid, compact JSON, parsable by standard parsers. 
"""

SELECTION_PROMPT = """
You will be given three inputs:
- `selection`: A selected word or phrase.
- `safe_context`: Text that appears *before* the selection in the original source.
- `spoiler_context`: Text that appears *after* the selection in the original source.

Your task is to derive and return the context-aware meaning of the selection from two perspectives:
- `spoiler_free_explination`: What the selection most likely meant given only the *safe_context*.
- `spoiler_explination`: What the selection most likely means given both *safe_context* and *spoiler_context*.

### Constraints:
- Focus on semantic interpretation that may evolve or change due to additional context.
- Be concise and avoid repeating the input text.
- Output the result strictly in valid JSON format.
