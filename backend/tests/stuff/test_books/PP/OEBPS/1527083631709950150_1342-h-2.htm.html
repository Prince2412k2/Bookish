<p>“If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and
me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
lives; for a whole day’s <i>tête-à-tête</i> between two women can never
end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of
this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.
Yours ever,</p>

<p class="r">
“<span class="smcap">Caroline Bingley</span>.”<br/>
</p></div>

<p>“With the officers!” cried Lydia: “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of
<i>that</i>.”</p>

<p>“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet; “that is very unlucky.”</p>

<p>“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.</p>

<p>“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
rain; and then you must stay all night.”</p>

<p>“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{40}" id="pgepubid00065"><a id="page_40" title="{40}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“Oh, but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to Meryton;
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”</p>

<p>“I had much rather go in the coach.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are
wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 433px;">
<span id="img_images_i_069.jpg"></span>
<div class="caption" id="ebm_caption7"><p>Cheerful prognostics</p></div>
</div>

<p>“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”</p>

<p>“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose
will be answered.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{41}" id="pgepubid00066"><a id="page_41" title="{41}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad
day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it
rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
Jane certainly could not come back.</p>

<p>“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet, more than
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next
morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
brought the following note for Elizabeth:—</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="nind">“My dearest Lizzie,</p>

<p>“I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will
not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on
my seeing Mr. Jones—therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear
of his having been to me—and, excepting a sore throat and a
headache, there is not much the matter with me.</p>

<p class="r">
“Yours, etc.”<br/>
</p></div>

<p>“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness—if she
should die—it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{42}" id="pgepubid00067"><a id="page_42" title="{42}"></a></span> not die of little
trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays
there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the
carriage.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the
carriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking was
her only alternative. She declared her resolution.</p>

<p>“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get
there.”</p>

<p>“I shall be very fit to see Jane—which is all I want.”</p>

<p>“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the
horses?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,
when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”</p>

<p>“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”</p>

<p>“We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.
Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off
together.</p>

<p>“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may
see something of Captain Carter, before he goes.”</p>

<p>In Meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles, with impatient activity, and finding herself at last
within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{43}" id="pgepubid00068"><a id="page_43" title="{43}"></a></span></p>

<p>She was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.
That she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such
dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt
for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their
brother’s manners there was something better than politeness—there was
good-humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst
nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the
brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to
the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was
thinking only of his breakfast.</p>

<p>Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss
Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well
enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,
however, to much conversation; and when Miss Bingley left them together,
could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended
her.</p>

<span id="img_images_i_073.jpg"></span>
<div class="caption" id="ebm_caption8"><p>
“The Apothecary came”<br/>
</p></div>
</div>

<p>When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came; and having
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a
violent cold, and that they must endeavour to<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{44}" id="pgepubid00069"><a id="page_44" title="{44}"></a></span> get the better of it;
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
nothing to do elsewhere.</p>

<p>When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very
unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
at parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the
present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was
despatched to Longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
back a supply of clothes.</p>

CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">
<span id="img_images_i_074_b.png">A</span></span>T five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six
Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley, she could not make a very
favourable answer.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{46}"><a id="page_46" title="{46}"></a></span> Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
indifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restored
Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.</p>

<p>Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his
attentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was
engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.
Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain
dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.</p>

<p>When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed,—a mixture of pride and impertinence:
she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst
thought the same, and added,—</p>

<p>“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really
looked almost wild.”</p>

<p>“She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very
nonsensical to come at all! Why must <i>she</i> be scampering about the
country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowzy!<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{47}" id="pgepubid00072"><a id="page_47" title="{47}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
in mud, I am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to
hide it not doing its office.”</p>

<p>“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was
all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well
when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite
escaped my notice.”</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see <i>your sister</i> make such
an exhibition.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p>“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by
it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most country-town indifference to decorum.”</p>

<p>“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said
Bingley.</p>

<p>“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,
“that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” A
short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again,—</p>

<p>“I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,—she is really a very sweet
girl,—and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such
a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no
chance of it.”</p>

<p>“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
Meryton?<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{48}" id="pgepubid00073"><a id="page_48" title="{48}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”</p>

<p>“That is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“If they had uncles enough to fill <i>all</i> Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it
would not make them one jot less agreeable.”</p>

<p>“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.</p>

<p>To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friend’s vulgar relations.</p>

<p>With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on
leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.
She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and
when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
down stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room, she found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
them to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the
excuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay
below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.</p>

<p>“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”</p>

<p>“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great
reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”</p>

<p>“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{49}" id="pgepubid00074"><a id="page_49" title="{49}"></a></span> Elizabeth; “I
am <i>not</i> a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”</p>

<p>“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and
I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table
where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her
others; all that his library afforded.</p>

<p>“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but I am an idle fellow; and though I have not many, I have more
than I ever looked into.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room.</p>

<p>“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left
so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at
Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”</p>

<p>“It ought to be good,” he replied: “it has been the work of many
generations.”</p>

<p>“And then you have added so much to it yourself—you are always buying
books.”</p>

<p>“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these.”</p>

<p>“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place. Charles, when you build <i>your</i> house, I wish it may be
half as delightful as Pemberley.”</p>

<p>“I wish it may.”</p>

<p>“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a
finer county in England than Derbyshire.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{50}" id="pgepubid00075"><a id="page_50" title="{50}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“With all my heart: I will buy Pemberley itself, if Darcy will sell it.”</p>

<p>“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little
attention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near
the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest
sister, to observe the game.</p>

<p>“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley: “will
she be as tall as I am?”</p>

<p>“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or
rather taller.”</p>

<p>“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me
so much. Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished
for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”</p>

<p>“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished as they all are.”</p>

<p>“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and
net purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and I am
sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without
being informed that she was very accomplished.”</p>

<p>“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has
too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but I am very
far<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{51}" id="pgepubid00076"><a id="page_51" title="{51}"></a></span> from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I
cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my
acquaintance that are really accomplished.”</p>

<p>“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.</p>

<p>“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really
esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all
this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but half deserved.”</p>

<p>“All this she must possess,” added Darcy; “and to all she must yet add
something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive
reading.”</p>

<p>“I am no longer surprised at your knowing <i>only</i> six accomplished women.
I rather wonder now at your knowing <i>any</i>.”</p>

<p>“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
this?”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> never saw such a woman. <i>I</i> never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe, united.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{52}" id="pgepubid00077"><a id="page_52" title="{52}"></a></span>
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all
conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room.</p>

<p>“Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is
one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other
sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I daresay, it
succeeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
“there is meanness in <i>all</i> the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable.”</p>

<p>Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject.</p>

<p>Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones’s being sent for
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled
that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet
were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief to
his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{53}" id="pgepubid00078"><a id="page_53" title="{53}"></a></span></p>

CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">
<span id="img_images_i_082_b.png">E</span></span>LIZABETH passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters. In spite of this amendment,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{54}"><a id="page_54" title="{54}"></a></span> however, she requested to have a
note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her
own judgment of her situation. The note was immediately despatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her
two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.</p>

<p>Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She
would not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
Bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes
that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.</p>

<p>“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be
moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass
a little longer on your kindness.”</p>

<p>“Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am
sure, will not hear of her removal.”</p>

<p>“You may depend upon it, madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,
“that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she
remains with us.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.</p>

<p>“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, I do not
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a
vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{55}" id="pgepubid00080"><a id="page_55" title="{55}"></a></span> the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to
<i>her</i>. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect
over that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is
equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I
hope, though you have but a short lease.”</p>

<p>“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I
should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five
minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”</p>

<p>“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.</p>

<p>“Oh yes—I understand you perfectly.”</p>

<p>“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through, I am afraid, is pitiful.”</p>

<p>“That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”</p>

<p>“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”</p>

<p>“I did not know before,” continued Bingley, immediately, “that you were
a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but intricate characters are the <i>most</i> amusing. They have at
least that advantage.”</p>

<p>“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for
such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and
unvarying society.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{56}" id="pgepubid00081"><a id="page_56" title="{56}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of <i>that</i>
going on in the country as in town.”</p>

<p>Everybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph,—</p>

<p>“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for
my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal
pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?”</p>

<p>“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; and
when I am in town, it is pretty much the same. They have each their
advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”</p>

<p>“Ay, that is because you have the right disposition. But that
gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing
at all.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her
mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
you must acknowledge to be true.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”</p>

<p>Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards
Mr. Darcy with a<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{57}" id="pgepubid00082"><a id="page_57" title="{57}"></a></span> very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since <i>her</i> coming away.</p>

<p>“Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir
William is, Mr. Bingley—is not he? so much the man of fashion! so
genteel and so easy! He has always something to say to everybody. <i>That</i>
is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very
important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.”</p>

<p>“Did Charlotte dine with you?”</p>

<p>“No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For
my part, Mr. Bingley, <i>I</i> always keep servants that can do their own
work; <i>my</i> daughters are brought up differently. But everybody is to
judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I
assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that <i>I</i> think
Charlotte so <i>very</i> plain; but then she is our particular friend.”</p>

<p>“She seems a very pleasant young woman,” said Bingley.</p>

<p>“Oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself
has often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boast
of my own child; but to be sure, Jane—one does not often see anybody
better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own
partiality. When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my
brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her, that my
sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.
But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he
wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{58}" id="pgepubid00083"><a id="page_58" title="{58}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth, impatiently. “There has
been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”</p>

<p>“I have been used to consider poetry as the <i>food</i> of love,” said Darcy.</p>

<p>“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is
strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”</p>

<p>Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to
Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part,
indeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the
youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.</p>

<p>Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high
animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{59}" id="pgepubid00084"><a id="page_59" title="{59}"></a></span> dinners and her
own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was
very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the
ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be
the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer
to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother’s ear.</p>

<p>“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and, when
your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of
the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?”</p>

<p>Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh yes—it would be much better to
wait till Jane was well; and by that time, most likely, Captain Carter
would be at Meryton again. And when you have given <i>your</i> ball,” she
added, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel
Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of <i>her</i>, in spite of
all Miss Bingley’s witticisms on <i>fine eyes</i>.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{60}" id="pgepubid00085"><a id="page_60" title="{60}"></a></span></p>

<br/>
CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">
<span id="img_images_i_089_b.png">T</span></span>HE day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss
Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
continued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, Elizabeth joined
their party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear.
Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching
the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and
Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.</p>

<p>Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual
commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
exactly in unison with her opinion of each.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{61}" id="pgepubid00087"><a id="page_61" title="{61}"></a></span></p>

<p>“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”</p>

<p>He made no answer.</p>

<p>“You write uncommonly fast.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”</p>

<p>“How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a
year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!”</p>

<p>“It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.”</p>

<p>“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”</p>

<p>“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend
pens remarkably well.”</p>

<p>“Thank you—but I always mend my own.”</p>

<p>“How can you contrive to write so even?”</p>

<p>He was silent.</p>

<p>“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,
and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
Grantley’s.”</p>

<p>“Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At
present I have not room to do them justice.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you
always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”</p>

<p>“They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
to determine.”</p>

<p>“It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with
ease cannot write ill.”</p>

<p>“That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her
brother, “because he does <i>not</i> write with ease.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{62}" id="pgepubid00088"><a id="page_62" title="{62}"></a></span> He studies too much
for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”</p>

<p>“My style of writing is very different from yours.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”</p>

<p>“My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them; by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”</p>

<p>“Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”</p>

<p>“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of
humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast.”</p>

<p>“And which of the two do you call <i>my</i> little recent piece of modesty?”</p>

<p>“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you
think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with
quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.
Bennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”</p>

<p>“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I
believed what I<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{63}" id="pgepubid00089"><a id="page_63" title="{63}"></a></span> said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”</p>

<p>“I daresay you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you
would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as
dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better stay
till next week,’ you would probably do it—you would probably not
go—and, at another word, might stay a month.”</p>

<p>“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much
more than he did himself.”</p>

<p>“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend; for he would certainly think the better of me if, under such a
circumstance, I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
could.”</p>

<p>“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter—Darcy must speak for
himself.”</p>

<p>“You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,
but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to
stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,
that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{64}" id="pgepubid00090"><a id="page_64" title="{64}"></a></span> and
the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering
one argument in favour of its propriety.”</p>

<p>“To yield readily—easily—to the <i>persuasion</i> of a friend is no merit
with you.”</p>

<p>“To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either.”</p>

<p>“You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend,
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”</p>

<p>“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange
with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties?”</p>

<p>“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more
weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure
you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not
know a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions, and in<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{65}" id="pgepubid00091"><a id="page_65" title="{65}"></a></span>
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,
when he has nothing to do.”</p>

<p>Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense.</p>

<p>“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument,
and want to silence this.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”</p>

<p>“What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.
Darcy had much better finish his letter.”</p>

<p>Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.</p>

<p>When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth
for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to
the pianoforte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the
way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister; and while they were thus employed,
Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed
on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man, and yet that he should look at her because
he disliked her was still more strange. She could only imagine, however,
at last, that she drew his notice because there was something about her
more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in
any other person present.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{66}" id="pgepubid00092"><a id="page_66" title="{66}"></a></span> The supposition did not pain her. She liked
him too little to care for his approbation.</p>

<p>After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a
lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near
Elizabeth, said to her,—</p>

<p>“Do you not feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel?”</p>

<p>She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said she, “I heard you before; but I could not immediately
determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell
you that I do not want to dance a reel at all; and now despise me if you
dare.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I do not dare.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody, and Darcy had
never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really
believed that, were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger.</p>

<p>Miss Bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.</p>

<p>“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{67}" id="pgepubid00093"><a id="page_67" title="{67}"></a></span> the shrubbery the
next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
and if you can compass it, to cure the younger girls of running after
the officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses.”</p>
