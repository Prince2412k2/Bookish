<p>“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in
her face.</p>

<p>As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
manner:—</p>

<p>“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I
come.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.</p>

<p>“Indeed, you are mistaken, madam; I have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here.”</p>

<p>“Miss Bennet,” replied her Ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to
know that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere <i>you</i> may
choose to be, you shall not find <i>me</i> so. My character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness; and in a cause of such
moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most
alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
<i>you</i>—that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew—my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I
<i>know</i> it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on
setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
you.”</p>

<p>“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring
with astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far. What could your Ladyship propose by it?”</p>

<p>“At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{436}" id="pgepubid00475"><a id="page_436" title="{436}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabeth
coolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it—if, indeed, such a report
is in existence.”</p>

<p>“If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad?”</p>

<p>“I never heard that it was.”</p>

<p>“And can you likewise declare, that there is no <i>foundation</i> for it?”</p>

<p>“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship. <i>You</i>
may ask questions which <i>I</i> shall not choose to answer.”</p>

<p>“This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”</p>

<p>“Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”</p>

<p>“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason. But <i>your</i> arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You
may have drawn him in.”</p>

<p>“If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”</p>

<p>“Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such
language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”</p>

<p>“But you are not entitled to know <i>mine</i>; nor will such behaviour as
this ever induce me to be explicit.”</p>

<p>“Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is
engaged to <i>my daughter</i>. Now, what have you to say?<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{437}" id="pgepubid00476"><a id="page_437" title="{437}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“Only this,—that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me.”</p>

<p>Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,—</p>

<p>“The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,
they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of
<i>his</i> mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles we planned the
union; and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be
accomplished, is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
the family? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends—to his
tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no
other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be
kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry
Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the
marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”</p>

<p>“Because honour, decorum, prudence—nay, interest—forbid it. Yes, Miss
Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will
be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{438}" id="pgepubid00477"><a id="page_438" title="{438}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife of Mr.
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine.”</p>

<p>“Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that
score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came
here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I
be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person’s
whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”</p>

<p>“<i>That</i> will make your Ladyship’s situation at present more pitiable;
but it will have no effect on <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“I will not be interrupted! Hear me in silence. My daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal
side, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s, from respectable,
honourable, and ancient, though untitled, families. Their fortune on
both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide
them?—the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family,
connections, or fortune! Is this to be endured? But it must not, shall
not be! If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to
quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.”</p>

<p>“In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s daughter; so far we are
equal.”</p>

<p>“True. You <i>are</i> a gentleman’s daughter. But what was your mother? Who
are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{439}" id="pgepubid00478"><a id="page_439" title="{439}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, once for all, are you engaged to him?”</p>

<p>Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a
moment’s deliberation,—</p>

<p>“I am not.”</p>

<p>Lady Catherine seemed pleased.</p>

<p>“And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement?”</p>

<p>“I will make no promise of the kind.”</p>

<p>“Miss Bennet, I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more
reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I
will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the
assurance I require.”</p>

<p>“And I certainly <i>never</i> shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable. Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry
your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make
<i>their</i> marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to
me, would <i>my</i> refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on
his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with
which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as
frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my
character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in <i>his</i> affairs,
I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in
mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no further on the
subject.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{440}" id="pgepubid00479"><a id="page_440" title="{440}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the
objections I have already urged I have still another to add. I am no
stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s infamous
elopement. I know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was a
patched-up business, at the expense of your father and uncle. And is
<i>such</i> a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is <i>her</i> husband, who is the son
of his late father’s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!—of
what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”</p>

<p>“You can <i>now</i> have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered.
“You have insulted me, in every possible method. I must beg to return to
the house.”</p>

<p>And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned
back. Her Ladyship was highly incensed.</p>

<p>“You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”</p>

<p>“Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.”</p>

<p>“You are then resolved to have him?”</p>

<p>“I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,
which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
reference to <i>you</i>, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”</p>

<p>“It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.”</p>

<p>“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “has any
possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either
would be violated by my<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{441}" id="pgepubid00480"><a id="page_441" title="{441}"></a></span> marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the
resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
<i>were</i> excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s
concern—and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
the scorn.”</p>

<p>“And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I
shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you
reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point.”</p>

<p>In this manner Lady Catherine talked on till they were at the door of
the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,—</p>

<p>“I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your
mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
Ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs. Her mother
impatiently met her at the door of her dressing-room, to ask why Lady
Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.</p>

<p>“She did not choose it,” said her daughter; “she would go.”</p>

<p>“She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously
civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.
She is on her road somewhere, I dare say; and so, passing through
Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had
nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?”</p>

<p>Elizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{442}" id="pgepubid00481"><a id="page_442" title="{442}"></a></span></p>

CHAPTER LVII.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">
<span id="img_images_i_471_b.png">T</span></span>HE discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw
Elizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many
hours learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.
Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of
their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;
till she recollected that <i>his</i> being the intimate friend of Bingley,
and <i>her</i> being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the
expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply
the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at
Lucas Lodge, therefore, (for through their<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{443}" id="pgepubid00483"><a id="page_443" title="{443}"></a></span> communication with the
Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine,) had
only set <i>that</i> down as almost certain and immediate which <i>she</i> had
looked forward to as possible at some future time.</p>

<p>In revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to
prevent the marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an
application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared
not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her Ladyship than <i>she</i> could do; and it
was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with <i>one</i>
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would
probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.</p>

<p>If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity
unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady
Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.</p>

<p>“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his
friend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to understand
it. I shall then give<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{444}" id="pgepubid00484"><a id="page_444" title="{444}"></a></span> over every expectation, every wish of his
constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him
at all.”</p>

<p>The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great: but they obligingly satisfied it with the same
kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet’s curiosity; and
Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.</p>

<p>The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her
father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.</p>

<p>“Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you: come into my room.”</p>

<p>She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell
her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might
be from Lady Catherine, and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations.</p>

<p>She followed her father to the fireplace, and they both sat down. He
then said,—</p>

<p>“I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents. I did not know before that I had <i>two</i> daughters on the brink
of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”</p>

<p>The colour now rushed into Elizabeth’s cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself, when her father continued,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{445}" id="pgepubid00485"><a id="page_445" title="{445}"></a></span>—</p>

<p>“You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but I think I may defy even <i>your</i> sagacity to discover the
name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.”</p>

<p>“From Mr. Collins! and what can <i>he</i> have to say?”</p>

<p>“Something very much to the purpose, of course. He begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping
Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says
on that point. What relates to yourself is as follows:—‘Having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another,
of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter
Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after
her eldest sister has resigned it; and the chosen partner of her fate
may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages
in this land.’ Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?
‘This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything the
heart of mortal can most desire,—splendid property, noble kindred, and
extensive patronage. Yet, in spite of all these temptations, let me warn
my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a
precipitate closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course,
you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.’ Have you any idea,
Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out. ‘My motive for
cautioning you is as follows:—We have reason to imagine that his aunt,
Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly
eye.’ <i>Mr. Darcy</i>, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{446}" id="pgepubid00486"><a id="page_446" title="{446}"></a></span> I <i>have</i>
surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more
effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at <i>you</i> in
his life! It is admirable!”</p>

<p>Elizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her.</p>

<p>“Are you not diverted?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Pray read on.”</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship last
night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that, on the score of
some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give
her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my
duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she
and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ Mr.
Collins, moreover, adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia’s sad
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place should be so generally
known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an
encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should
very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as
a Christian, but never to admit them<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{447}"><a id="page_447" title="{447}"></a></span> in your sight, or allow their
names to be mentioned in your hearing.’ <i>That</i> is his notion of
Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear
Charlotte’s situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But,
Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be
<i>missish</i>, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For
what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them
in our turn?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Elizabeth, “I am exceedingly diverted. But it is so
strange!”</p>

<p>“Yes, <i>that</i> is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but <i>his</i> perfect indifference and <i>your</i>
pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate
writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins’s correspondence for any
consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving
him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine
about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?”</p>

<p>To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his
repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh when she
would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her by
what he said of Mr. Darcy’s indifference; and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that, perhaps, instead of
his seeing too <i>little</i>, she might have fancied too <i>much</i>.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{448}" id="pgepubid00487"><a id="page_448" title="{448}"></a></span></p>

CHAPTER LVIII.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">
<span id="img_images_i_477_b.png">I</span></span>NSTEAD of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy
with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine’s
visit. The gentlemen<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{449}"><a id="page_449" title="{449}"></a></span> arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to
tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in
momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed
their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the
habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five
set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to
outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy
were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was
too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and, perhaps, he might be doing the same.</p>

<p>They walked towards the Lucases’, because Kitty wished to call upon
Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed; and while her courage was
high, she immediately said,—</p>

<p>“Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature, and for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings care not how much I may be wounding yours. I
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor
sister. Ever since I have known it I have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest
of my family I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise
and emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner
was so little to be trusted.”</p>

<p>“You must not blame my aunt. Lydia’s thoughtlessness<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{450}" id="pgepubid00489"><a id="page_450" title="{450}"></a></span> first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could
not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,
in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
sake of discovering them.”</p>

<p>“If you <i>will</i> thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself alone.
That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your
<i>family</i> owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought
only of <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,
her companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with me. If your
feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. <i>My</i>
affections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change since the period to which he alluded, as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The
happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth
been able to encounter his eyes, she might have seen how well the
expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him: but
though she could not look she could listen; and he told her of<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{451}" id="pgepubid00490"><a id="page_451" title="{451}"></a></span> feelings
which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection
every moment more valuable.</p>

<p>They walked on without knowing in what direction. There was too much to
be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt, who <i>did</i> call on him in her return through
London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the
substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter, which, in her Ladyship’s apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from
her nephew which <i>she</i> had refused to give. But, unluckily for her
Ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.</p>

<p>“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to Lady Catherine frankly and openly.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know enough of
my <i>frankness</i> to believe me capable of <i>that</i>. After abusing you so
abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations.”</p>

<p>“What did you say of me that I did not deserve? For though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour
to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was
unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”</p>

<p>“We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{452}" id="pgepubid00491"><a id="page_452" title="{452}"></a></span> of neither, if strictly
examined, will be irreproachable; but since then we have both, I hope,
improved in civility.”</p>

<p>“I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your
reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: ‘Had you behaved in a
more gentlemanlike manner.’ Those were your words. You know not, you can
scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; though it was some time, I
confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”</p>

<p>“I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way.”</p>

<p>“I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never
forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible
way that would induce you to accept me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at
all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”</p>

<p>Darcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he,—“did it <i>soon</i> make you
think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?”</p>

<p>She explained what its effects on her had been, and how gradually all
her former prejudices had been removed.</p>

<p>“I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part,
especially the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power
of<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{453}" id="pgepubid00492"><a id="page_453" title="{453}"></a></span> reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly
make you hate me.”</p>

<p>“The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily
changed as that implies.”</p>

<p>“When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself perfectly
calm and cool; but I am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit.”</p>

<p>“The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The
adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings
of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely
different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance
attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my
philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure.”</p>

<p>“I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. <i>Your</i>
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of
ignorance. But with <i>me</i>, it is not so. Painful recollections will
intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been a
selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a
child I was taught what was <i>right</i>, but I was not taught to correct my
temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride
and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only <i>child</i>),
I was spoiled by my parents, who, though good themselves, (my father
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond
my<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{454}" id="pgepubid00493"><a id="page_454" title="{454}"></a></span> own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to
<i>wish</i> at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with
my own. Such I was, from eight to eight-and-twenty; and such I might
still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not
owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a
doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.”</p>

<p>“Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses.”</p>

<p>“My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure
you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me
wrong. How you must have hated me after <i>that</i> evening!”</p>

<p>“Hate you! I was angry, perhaps, at first, but my anger soon began to
take a proper direction.”</p>

<p>“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at
Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, I felt nothing but surprise.”</p>

<p>“Your surprise could not be greater than <i>mine</i> in being noticed by you.
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I
confess that I did not expect to receive <i>more</i> than my due.”</p>

<p>“My object <i>then</i>,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility
in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped
to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes
introduced themselves, I can hardly<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{455}" id="pgepubid00494"><a id="page_455" title="{455}"></a></span> tell, but I believe in about half
an hour after I had seen you.”</p>

<p>He then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there
had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend.</p>

<p>She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
each to be dwelt on farther.</p>

<p>After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
it was time to be at home.</p>

<p>“What could have become of Mr. Bingley and Jane?” was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of <i>their</i> affairs. Darcy was delighted with
their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
it.</p>

<p>“I must ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.”</p>

<p>“That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.” And
though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
the case.</p>

<p>“On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a
confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told
him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his
affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had
the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{456}" id="pgepubid00495"><a id="page_456" title="{456}"></a></span> believed myself
mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent
to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend.</p>

<p>“Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him
that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”</p>

<p>“From the former. I had narrowly observed her, during the two visits
which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection.”</p>

<p>“And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to
him.”</p>

<p>“It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
his reliance on mine made everything easy. I was obliged to confess one
thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was
angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister’s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me
now.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful
friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and
it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of
Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he
continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they
parted.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{457}" id="pgepubid00496"><a id="page_457" title="{457}"></a></span></p>

CHAPTER LIX.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">
“<span id="img_images_i_486_b.png">M</span></span>Y dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a question
which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and
from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in
reply, that<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{458}"><a id="page_458" title="{458}"></a></span> they had wandered about till she was beyond her own
knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.</p>

<p>The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed; the unacknowledged were silent.
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather <i>knew</i> that she was happy
than <i>felt</i> herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in
the family when her situation became known: she was aware that no one
liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
<i>dislike</i> which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.</p>

<p>At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far
from Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.</p>

<p>“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be! Engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,
you shall not deceive me: I know it to be impossible.”</p>

<p>“This is a wretched beginning, indeed! My sole dependence was on you;
and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I
am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we
are engaged.”</p>

<p>Jane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much
you dislike him.”</p>

<p>“You know nothing of the matter. <i>That</i> is all to be forgot. Perhaps I
did not always love him so well as I do now; but in such cases as these
a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever
remember it myself.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{459}" id="pgepubid00498"><a id="page_459" title="{459}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more
seriously, assured her of its truth.</p>

<p>“Good heaven! can it be really so? Yet now I must believe you,” cried
Jane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would, I do congratulate you; but are you
certain—forgive the question—are you quite certain that you can be
happy with him?”</p>

<p>“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already that we
are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane?
Shall you like to have such a brother?”</p>

<p>“Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more
delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you
really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than
marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! You will only think I feel <i>more</i> than I ought to do when I
tell you all.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am
afraid you will be angry.”</p>

<p>“My dearest sister, now be, <i>be</i> serious. I want to talk very seriously.
Let me know everything that I am to know without delay. Will you tell me
how long you have loved him?”</p>

<p>“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began;
but I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at Pemberley.”</p>

<p>Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
further to wish.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{460}" id="pgepubid00499"><a id="page_460" title="{460}"></a></span></p>

<p>“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself. I
always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I
must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley’s friend and your
husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But,
Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you
tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know
of it to another, not to you.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to
mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend: but now she would no longer
conceal from her his share in Lydia’s marriage. All was acknowledged,
and half the night spent in conversation.</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next
morning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with
our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?
Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley’s
way.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet.</p>

<p>As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;
and he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”</p>

<p>“I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{461}" id="pgepubid00500"><a id="page_461" title="{461}"></a></span> Bennet, “to walk
to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has
never seen the view.”</p>

<p>“It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am
sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?”</p>

<p>Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great
curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently
consented. As she went upstairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her,
saying,—</p>

<p>“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself; but I hope you will not mind it. It is
all for Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to
him except just now and then; so do not put yourself to inconvenience.”</p>

<p>During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should be
asked in the course of the evening: Elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mother’s. She could not determine how her mother
would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man; but whether she
were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to
her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the
first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation.</p>

<p>In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme. She did not fear her father’s opposition, but he was going to
be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means; that <i>she</i>,
his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
filling him with fears and regrets in<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{462}" id="pgepubid00501"><a id="page_462" title="{462}"></a></span> disposing of her, was a wretched
reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, “Go to your father; he
wants you in the library.” She was gone directly.</p>

<p>Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses to be
accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”</p>

<p>How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,
of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.</p>

<p>“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.
But will they make you happy?”</p>

<p>“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my
indifference?”</p>

<p>“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
this would be nothing if you really liked him.”</p>

<p>“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes; “I love him.
Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not
know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms.”</p>

<p>“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the kind
of man, indeed, to whom I<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{463}" id="pgepubid00502"><a id="page_463" title="{463}"></a></span> should never dare refuse anything, which he
condescended to ask. I now give it to <i>you</i>, if you are resolved on
having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your
disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband, unless you looked
up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape
discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing
<i>you</i> unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are
about.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;
and, at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the
object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her
estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many
months’ suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities,
she did conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the
match.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to
say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with
you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”</p>

<p>To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy
had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.</p>

<p>“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did everything;
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him
his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble
and economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and <i>would</i> have
paid him; but these violent<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{464}" id="pgepubid00503"><a id="page_464" title="{464}"></a></span> young lovers carry everything their own
way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow, he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”</p>

<p>He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading
Mr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
at last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come
for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
half an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure. Everything was too recent for
gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer
anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time.</p>

<p>When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;
for, on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to
utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could
comprehend what she heard, though not in general backward to credit what
was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a
lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in
her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.</p>

<p>“Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would
have thought it? And is it really true? Oh, my sweetest Lizzy! how rich
and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
you will have! Jane’s is nothing to it—nothing at all. I am so
pleased—so happy. Such a charming man! so handsome! so tall! Oh, my
dear<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{465}" id="pgepubid00504"><a id="page_465" title="{465}"></a></span> Lizzy! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before. I
hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Everything
that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,
Lord! what will become of me? I shall go distracted.”</p>

<p>This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted; and
Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,
her mother followed her.</p>

<p>“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else. Ten
thousand a year, and very likely more! ’Tis as good as a lord! And a
special licence—you must and shall be married by a special licence.
But, my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond
of, that I may have it to-morrow.”</p>

<p>This was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations’
consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow
passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak
to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark
her deference for his opinion.</p>

<p>Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem.</p>

<p>“I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “Wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but I think I shall like <i>your</i> husband quite as well
as Jane’s.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{466}" id="pgepubid00505"><a id="page_466" title="{466}"></a></span>”</p>

CHAPTER LX.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">
<span id="img_images_i_495_b.png">E</span></span>LIZABETH’S spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.
Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “How could
you begin?” said she. “I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place?<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{467}"><a id="page_467" title="{467}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I
knew that I <i>had</i> begun.”</p>

<p>“My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners—my behaviour
to <i>you</i> was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now, be
sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?”</p>

<p>“For the liveliness of your mind I did.”</p>

<p>“You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.
The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,
and looking, and thinking for <i>your</i> approbation alone. I roused and
interested you, because I was so unlike <i>them</i>. Had you not been really
amiable you would have hated me for it: but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you. There—I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;
and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
reasonable. To be sure you know no actual good of me—but nobody thinks
of <i>that</i> when they fall in love.”</p>

<p>“Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was
ill at Netherfield?”</p>

<p>“Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it
by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be; and I shall begin directly, by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last?<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{468}" id="pgepubid00507"><a id="page_468" title="{468}"></a></span> What made you so shy of me, when you
first called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you
called, did you look as if you did not care about me?”</p>

<p>“Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.”</p>

<p>“But I was embarrassed.”</p>

<p>“And so was I.”</p>

<p>“You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”</p>

<p>“A man who had felt less might.”</p>

<p>“How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you
<i>would</i> have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when
you <i>would</i> have spoken if I had not asked you! My resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. <i>Too
much</i>, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the
subject? This will never do.”</p>

<p>“You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady
Catherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of
removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to
wait for an opening of yours. My aunt’s intelligence had given me hope,
and I was determined at once to know everything.”</p>

<p>“Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to
Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?
or had you intended any more serious consequences?<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{469}" id="pgepubid00508"><a id="page_469" title="{469}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“My real purpose was to see <i>you</i>, and to judge, if I could, whether I
might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to
myself, was to see whether your sister was still partial to Bingley, and
if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.”</p>

<p>“Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to
befall her?”</p>

<p>“I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought to
be done; and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done
directly.”</p>

<p>“And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But
I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”</p>

<p>From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy
had been overrated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner’s
long letter; but now, having <i>that</i> to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt
had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:—</p>

<p>“I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,
for your long, kind, satisfactory detail of particulars; but, to say the
truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.
But <i>now</i> suppose as much as you choose; give a loose to your fancy,
indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will
afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly
err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more
than you did in your last. I thank you again and again, for not going to
the Lakes. How could I be so<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{470}" id="pgepubid00509"><a id="page_470" title="{470}"></a></span> silly as to wish it! Your idea of the
ponies is delightful. We will go round the park every day. I am the
happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so
before, but no one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she
only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that
can be spared from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.
Yours,” etc.</p>

<p>Mr. Darcy’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style, and still
different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in return
for his last.</p>
