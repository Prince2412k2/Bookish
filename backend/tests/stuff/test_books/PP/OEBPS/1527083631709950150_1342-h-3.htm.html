<p>“Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{68}" id="pgepubid00094"><a id="page_68" title="{68}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“Oh yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed
in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the
judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different
lines. As for your Elizabeth’s picture, you must not attempt to have it
taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”</p>

<p>“It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression; but their
colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied.”</p>

<p>At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and
Elizabeth herself.</p>

<p>“I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard.</p>

<p>“You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away without
telling us that you were coming out.”</p>

<p>Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk
by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,
and immediately said,—</p>

<p>“This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the
avenue.”</p>

<p>But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered,—</p>

<p>“No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to
uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>She then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{69}" id="pgepubid00095"><a id="page_69" title="{69}"></a></span></p>

CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">
<span id="img_images_i_098_b.png">W</span></span>HEN the ladies removed after dinner Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and
seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room,
where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of
pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were
during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers
of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment
with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their
acquaintance with spirit.</p>

<p>But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{70}" id="pgepubid00097"><a id="page_70" title="{70}"></a></span> the first object;
Miss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed
himself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst
also made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness
and warmth remained for Bingley’s salutation. He was full of joy and
attention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
should suffer from the change of room; and she removed, at his desire,
to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the
door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.
Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
delight.</p>

<p>When tea was over Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table—but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.
Darcy did not wish for cards, and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the
silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.
Hurst had, therefore, nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the
sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book. Miss Bingley did the same;
and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and
rings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with Miss
Bennet.</p>

<p>Miss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.
Darcy’s progress through <i>his</i> book, as in reading her own; and she was
perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She
could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
question and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book, which she<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{71}" id="pgepubid00098"><a id="page_71" title="{71}"></a></span> had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it
is to spend an evening in this way! I declare, after all, there is no
enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a
book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not
an excellent library.”</p>

<p>No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him and said,—</p>

<p>“By the bye Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not
some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure.”</p>

<p>“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he
chooses, before it begins; but as for the ball, it is quite a settled
thing, and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send
round my cards.”</p>

<p>“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the
day.”</p>

<p>“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say; but it would not be
near so much like a ball.”</p>

<p>Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about
the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at
whom it was<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{72}" id="pgepubid00099"><a id="page_72" title="{72}"></a></span> all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the
desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and,
turning to Elizabeth, said,—</p>

<p>“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so
long in one attitude.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility: Mr. Darcy looked
up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that
he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down
the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would
interfere. What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his
meaning—and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” was her answer; “but, depend upon it, he means to be
severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask
nothing about it.”</p>

<p>Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in
anything, and persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of his
two motives.</p>

<p>“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon
as she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, I should be
completely in your way; and if the second, I can admire you much better
as I sit by the fire.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{73}" id="pgepubid00100"><a id="page_73" title="{73}"></a></span> anything so
abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”</p>

<p>“Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “We
can all plague and punish one another. Tease him—laugh at him. Intimate
as you are, you must know how it is to be done.”</p>

<p>“But upon my honour I do <i>not</i>. I do assure you that my intimacy has not
yet taught me <i>that</i>. Tease calmness of temper and presence of mind! No,
no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose
ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr.
Darcy may hug himself.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to <i>me</i> to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a
laugh.”</p>

<p>“Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me credit for more than can be. The
wisest and best of men,—nay, the wisest and best of their actions,—may
be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a
joke.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth, “there are such people, but I hope I am
not one of <i>them</i>. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies
and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, <i>do</i> divert me, I own, and I
laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what
you are without.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of
my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule.”</p>

<p>“Such as vanity and pride.”</p>

<p>“Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride—where there is a real
superiority of mind—pride will be always under good regulation.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{74}" id="pgepubid00101"><a id="page_74" title="{74}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.</p>

<p>“Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley;
“and pray what is the result?”</p>

<p>“I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it
himself without disguise.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,
but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch
for. It is, I believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the
convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of
others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My
feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper
would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost is lost for
ever.”</p>

<p>“<i>That</i> is a failing, indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment
<i>is</i> a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I
really cannot <i>laugh</i> at it. You are safe from me.”</p>

<p>“There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”</p>

<p>“And <i>your</i> defect is a propensity to hate everybody.”</p>

<p>“And yours,” he replied, with a smile, “is wilfully to misunderstand
them.”</p>

<p>“Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a
conversation in which she had no share. “Louisa, you will not mind my
waking Mr. Hurst.”</p>

<p>Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was
opened; and Darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not sorry for
it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{75}" id="pgepubid00102"><a id="page_75" title="{75}"></a></span></p>

<br/>
<br/>
CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">
<span id="img_images_i_104_b.png">I</span></span>N consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the
next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which
would exactly finish Jane’s week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to Elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very
well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{76}"><a id="page_76" title="{76}"></a></span>
resolved—nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
contrary, of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.</p>

<p>The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on
Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay; for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.</p>

<p>The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be
safe for her—that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right.</p>

<p>To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence: Elizabeth had been at
Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked; and Miss
Bingley was uncivil to <i>her</i> and more teasing than usual to himself. He
wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should <i>now</i> escape him—nothing that could elevate her with the hope of
influencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea had been
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of Saturday: and though they were at
one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{77}" id="pgepubid00104"><a id="page_77" title="{77}"></a></span></p>

<p>On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to
see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest spirits.</p>

<p>They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its
animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human
nature; and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of
threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information
for them of a different sort. Much had been done, and much had been said
in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers
had dined lately with their uncle; a private had been flogged; and it
had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{78}" id="pgepubid00105"><a id="page_78" title="{78}"></a></span></p>

CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="nind">
<span class="letra">
<span id="img_images_i_107_b.png">“I</span></span>
hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.”</p>

<p>“Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,
unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in; and I hope <i>my</i> dinners
are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.”</p>

<p>“The person of whom I speak is a gentleman and a stranger.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled. “A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.
Bingley, I am sure. Why, Jane—you never dropped a word of this—you sly
thing! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.
But—good Lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got
to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell. I must speak to Hill this
moment.”</p>

<p>“It is <i>not</i> Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom I
never saw in the whole course of my life.”</p>

<p>This roused a general astonishment; and he had the<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{79}" id="pgepubid00107"><a id="page_79" title="{79}"></a></span> pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.</p>

<p>After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus
explained:—“About a month ago I received this letter, and about a
fortnight ago I answered it; for I thought it a case of some delicacy,
and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who,
when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he
pleases.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.
Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it.”</p>

<p>Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.
They had often attempted it before: but it was a subject on which Mrs.
Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.</p>

<p>“It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet; “and
nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.
But if you will listen to his letter, you may, perhaps, be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself.”</p>

<p>“No, that I am sure I shall not: and I think it was very impertinent of
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false
friends. Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father
did before him?”</p>

<p>“Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head, as you will hear.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{80}" id="pgepubid00108"><a id="page_80" title="{80}"></a></span>”</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">“Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, <i>15th October</i>.</p>

<p class="nind">
“Dear Sir,<br/>
</p>

<p>“The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
father always gave me much uneasiness; and, since I have had the
misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the
breach: but, for some time, I was kept back by my own doubts,
fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be
on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be
at variance.”—‘There, Mrs. Bennet.’—“My mind, however, is now
made up on the subject; for, having received ordination at Easter,
I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of
the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis
de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the
valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest
endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her
Ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies
which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman,
moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing
of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on
these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of
good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my
being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly
overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered
olive branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the
means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to
apologize for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make
them every possible amends; but of this hereafter. If you should
have no objection to receive me into<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{81}" id="pgepubid00109"><a id="page_81" title="{81}"></a></span> your house, I propose myself
the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday,
November 18th, by four o’clock, and shall probably trespass on your
hospitality till the Saturday se’nnight following, which I can do
without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting
to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other
clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day. I remain, dear sir,
with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your
well-wisher and friend,</p>

<p class="r">
“<span class="smcap">William Collins</span>.”<br/>
</p></div>

<p>“At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,”
said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. “He seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and, I doubt not, will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again.”</p>

<p>“There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however; and, if
he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
discourage him.”</p>

<p>“Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
credit.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady
Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required.</p>

<p>“He must be an oddity, I think,” said she. “I cannot make him out. There
is something very pompous in his style. And what can he mean by
apologizing for being next in the entail? We cannot suppose he would
help it, if he could. Can he be a sensible man, sir?”</p>

<p>“No, my dear; I think not. I have great hopes of<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{82}" id="pgepubid00110"><a id="page_82" title="{82}"></a></span> finding him quite the
reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter which promises well. I am impatient to see him.”</p>

<p>“In point of composition,” said Mary, “his letter does not seem
defective. The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I
think it is well expressed.”</p>

<p>To Catherine and Lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for
their mother, Mr. Collins’s letter had done away much of her ill-will,
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which
astonished her husband and daughters.</p>

<p>Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the
ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need
of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall,
heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated
before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this
instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not
doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. This
gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.
Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,—</p>

<p>“You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{83}" id="pgepubid00111"><a id="page_83" title="{83}"></a></span> my heart it may
prove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so
oddly.”</p>

<p>“You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”</p>

<p>“Ah, sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with <i>you</i>, for such things,
I know, are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed.”</p>

<p>“I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and
could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come
prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but, perhaps,
when we are better acquainted——”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s admiration. The
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;
and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet’s
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property. The dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admired;
and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its
cookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured
him, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep a good
cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged
pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared
herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologize for about a
quarter of an hour.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{84}" id="pgepubid00112"><a id="page_84" title="{84}"></a></span></p>

<span id="img_images_i_113_b.png">D</span></span>URING dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady
Catherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his
comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen
better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner; and with a most important aspect
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a
person of rank—such affability and condescension, as he had himself
experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to
approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,
and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many
people, he knew, but <i>he</i> had never seen anything but affability in her.
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{85}" id="pgepubid00114"><a id="page_85" title="{85}"></a></span> for a week or
two to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself,—some shelves in the closets upstairs.</p>

<p>“That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and I
dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?”</p>

<p>“The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane
from Rosings Park, her Ladyship’s residence.”</p>

<p>“I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?”</p>

<p>“She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
extensive property.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than
many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?”</p>

<p>“She is a most charming young lady, indeed. Lady Catherine herself says
that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks
the young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many
accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of, as I am
informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{86}" id="pgepubid00115"><a id="page_86" title="{86}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at
court.”</p>

<p>“Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived
the British Court of its brightest ornament. Her Ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to
ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her
charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess; and that the most
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
her. These are the kind of little things which please her Ladyship, and
it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay.”</p>

<p>“You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet; “and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or are the result of previous study?”</p>

<p>“They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time; and though I
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bennet’s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped; and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner
in his pleasure.</p>

<p>By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{87}" id="pgepubid00116"><a id="page_87" title="{87}"></a></span> Mr. Bennet was glad
to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over,
glad to invite him</p>

<p class="nind">to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book
was produced; but on beholding it (for everything announced it to be
from a circulating library)<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{88}" id="pgepubid00117"><a id="page_88" title="{88}"></a></span> he started back, and, begging pardon,
protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and Lydia
exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he
chose “Fordyce’s Sermons.” Lydia gaped as he opened the volume; and
before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she
interrupted him with,—</p>

<p>“Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away
Richard? and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me
so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.”</p>

<p>Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.
Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,—</p>

<p>“I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes
me, I confess; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.”</p>

<p>Then, turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs.
Bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for Lydia’s
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared
for backgammon.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{89}" id="pgepubid00118"><a id="page_89" title="{89}"></a></span></p>

<br/>
<br/>
CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">
<span id="img_images_i_118_b.png">M</span></span>R. COLLINS was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of
his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful
acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had
given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good
deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de
Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he
felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.</p>

<p>Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{90}" id="pgepubid00120"><a id="page_90" title="{90}"></a></span> meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.
This was his plan of amends—of atonement—for inheriting their father’s
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part.</p>

<p>His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet’s lovely face
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority; and for the first evening <i>she</i> was his settled
choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter
of an hour’s <i>tête-à-tête</i> with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a
conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at
Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. “As to
her <i>younger</i> daughters, she could not take upon her to say—she could
not positively answer—but she did not <i>know</i> of any prepossession;—her
<i>eldest</i> daughter she must just mention—she felt it incumbent on her to
hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”</p>

<p>Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth—and it was soon
done—done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
the day before, was now high in her good graces.</p>

<p>Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not for<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{91}" id="pgepubid00121"><a id="page_91" title="{91}"></a></span>gotten: every sister
except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,
at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed
him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.
Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such
doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told
Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the
house, he was used to be free from them there: his civility, therefore,
was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and
go.</p>

<p>In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by <i>him</i>. Their eyes
were immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, and
nothing less than a very smart bonnet, indeed, or a really new muslin in
a shop window, could recall them.</p>

<p>But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking
with an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very
Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and
he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger’s air, all
wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{92}" id="pgepubid00122"><a id="page_92" title="{92}"></a></span>
to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting
something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the
pavement, when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same
spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to
introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day
before from town, and, he was happy to say, had accepted a commission in
their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted
only regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was
greatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a fine
countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction
was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation—a
readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the
whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,
when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were
seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group
the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the
principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on
purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they
were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and Elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,
one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,
touched his hat—a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.
What could be the meaning of it?<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{93}"><a id="page_93" title="{93}"></a></span> It was impossible to imagine; it was
impossible not to long to know.</p>

<p>In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.</p>

<p>Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
Mr. Philips’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia’s
pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.
Philips’s throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the
invitation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from
their recent absence, were particularly welcome; and she was eagerly
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own
carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if
she had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shopboy in the street, who had
told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield,
because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed
towards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him. She received him with
her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,
apologizing for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with
her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be
justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to
her notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good
breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to
by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she
could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had
brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant’s
<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{94}" id="pgepubid00123"><a id="page_94" title="{94}"></a></span>commission in the ——shire. She had been watching him the last hour,
she said, as he walked up and down the street,—and had Mr. Wickham
appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation;
but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the
officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,
disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the
next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.
Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn
would come in the evening. This was agreed to; and Mrs. Philips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.
Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured,
with unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless.</p>

<p>As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or
both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such
behaviour than her sister.</p>

<p>Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.
Philips’s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady
Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for
she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be
attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so
much attention in the whole course of his life.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{95}" id="pgepubid00124"><a id="page_95" title="{95}"></a></span></p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00125"><a id="CHAPTER_XVI"/><span id="img_images_i_124_a.jpg"></span>
<br/>
<br/>
CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">
<span id="img_images_i_124_b.png">A</span></span>S no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with their
aunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the
girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that Mr. Wickham had<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{96}"><a id="page_96" title="{96}"></a></span> accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in
the house.</p>

<p>When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.
Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings
was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the
description of only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeeper’s room.</p>

<p>In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the
improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive
listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.
The gentlemen did approach: and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,
Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
of him since, with the smallest degree of <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{97}" id="pgepubid00126"><a id="page_97" title="{97}"></a></span>unreasonable admiration. The
officers of the ——shire were in general a very creditable,
gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party; but
Mr, Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as <i>they</i> were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.</p>
