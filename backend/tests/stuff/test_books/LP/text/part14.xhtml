<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Ah! Ah! I
am about to receive a visit from an admirer!"</span> he exclaimed
from afar, when he first saw the little prince coming.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;For, to conceited men, all other
men are admirers.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Good
morning,"</span> said the little prince. <span class="italic">"That
is a queer hat you are wearing."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It is a hat
for salutes,"</span> the conceited man replied. <span class=
"italic">"It is to raise in salute when people acclaim me.
Unfortunately, nobody at all ever passes this way."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"Yes?"</span> said the little prince, who did not
understand what the conceited man was talking about.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Clap your
hands, one against the other,"</span> the conceited man now
directed him.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The little prince clapped his
hands. The conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"This is
more entertaining than the visit to the king,"</span> the little
prince said to himself. And he began again to clap his hands, one
against the other. The conceited man again raised his hat in
salute.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;After five minutes of this
exercise the little prince grew tired of the game's monotony.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"And what
should one do to make the hat come down?"</span> he asked.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But the conceited man did not
hear him. Conceited people never hear anything but praise.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Do you
really admire me very much?"</span> he demanded of the little
prince.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"What does
that mean—'admire'?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"To admire
means that you regard me as the handsomest, the best-dressed, the
richest, and the most intelligent man on this planet."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"But you are
the only man on your planet!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Do me this
kindness. Admire me just the same."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I admire
you,"</span> said the little prince, shrugging his shoulders
slightly, <span class="italic">"but what is there in that to
interest you so much?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And the little prince went
away.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"The
grown-ups are certainly very odd,"</span> he said to himself, as he
continued on his journey.</div>
