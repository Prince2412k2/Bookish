<div class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9"><span class=
"bold">3</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;.</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00012.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;It took me a long time to learn
where he came from. The little prince, who asked me so many
questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It was from
words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was
revealed to me.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The first time he saw my
airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be
much too complicated for me), he asked me:</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00013.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"What is
that object?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"That is not
an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my
airplane."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And I was proud to have him learn
that I could fly.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;He cried out, then:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"What! You
dropped down from the sky?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"Yes,"</span> I answered, modestly.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Oh! That is
funny!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And the little prince broke into
a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. I like my
misfortunes to be taken seriously.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Then he added:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"So you,
too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;At that moment I caught a gleam
of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I
demanded, abruptly:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Do you come
from another planet?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But he did not reply. He tossed
his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It is true
that on that you can't have come from very far away . .
."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And he sank into a reverie, which
lasted a long time. Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he
buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;You can imagine how my curiosity
was aroused by this half-confidence about the <span class=
"italic">"other planets."</span> I made a great effort, therefore,
to find out more on this subject.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"My little
man, where do you come from? What is this 'where I live,' of which
you speak? Where do you want to take your sheep?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;After a reflective silence he
answered:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"The thing
that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he
can use it as his house."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"That is so.
And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can
tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But the little prince seemed
shocked by this offer:</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00014.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Tie him!
What a queer idea!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"But if you
don't tie him," I said, "he will wander off somewhere, and get
lost."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;My friend broke into another peal
of laughter:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"But where
do you think he would go?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Anywhere.
Straight ahead of him."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Then the little prince said,
earnestly:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"That
doesn't matter. Where I live, everything is so small!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And, with perhaps a hint of
sadness, he added:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Straight
ahead of him, nobody can go very far . . ."</span></div>
