<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But it happened that after
walking for a long time through sand, and rocks, and snow, the
little prince at last came upon a road. And all roads lead to the
abodes of men.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Good
morning,"</span> he said.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;He was standing before a garden,
all a-bloom with roses.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Good
morning,"</span> said the roses.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The little prince gazed at them.
They all looked like his flower.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Who are
you?"</span> he demanded, thunderstruck.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"We are
roses,"</span> the roses said.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And he was overcome with sadness.
His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in
all the universe. And here were five thousand of them, all alike,
in one single garden!</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"She would
be very much annoyed,"</span> he said to himself, <span class=
"italic">"if she should see that . . . She would cough most
dreadfully, and she would pretend that she was dying, to avoid
being laughed at. And I should be obliged to pretend that I was
nursing her back to life—for if I did not do that, to humble myself
also, she would really allow herself to die. . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Then he went on with his
reflections: <span class="italic">"I thought that I was rich, with
a flower that was unique in all the world; and all I had was a
common rose. A common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to my
knees—and one of them perhaps extinct forever . . . That doesn't
make me a very great prince . . ."</span></div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And he lay down in the grass and
cried.¨</div>
