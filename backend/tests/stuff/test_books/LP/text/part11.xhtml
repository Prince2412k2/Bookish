<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I soon learned to know this
flower better. On the little prince's planet the flowers had always
been very simple. They had only one ring of petals; they took up no
room at all; they were a trouble to nobody. One morning they would
appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded peacefully
away. But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new
flower had come up; and the little prince had watched very closely
over this small sprout which was not like any other small sprouts
on his planet. It might, you see, have been a new kind of
baobab.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The shrub soon stopped growing,
and began to get ready to produce a flower. The little prince, who
was present at the first appearance of a huge bud, felt at once
that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it. But
the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her
beauty in the shelter of her green chamber. She chose her colors
with the greatest care. She dressed herself slowly. She adjusted
her petals one by one. She did not wish to go out into the world
all rumpled, like the field poppies. It was only in the full
radiance of her beauty that she wished to appear. Oh, yes! She was
a coquettish creature! And her mysterious adornment lasted for days
and days.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Then one morning, exactly at
sunrise, she suddenly showed herself.</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00028.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And, after working with all this
painstaking precision, she yawned and said:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Ah! I am
scarcely awake. I beg that you will excuse me. My petals are still
all disarranged . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But the little prince could not
restrain his admiration:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Oh! How
beautiful you are!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Am I
not?"</span> the flower responded, sweetly. <span class=
"italic">"And I was born at the same moment as the sun . .
."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The little prince could guess
easily enough that she was not any too modest—but how moving—and
exciting—she was!</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I think it
is time for breakfast,"</span> she added an instant later.
<span class="italic">"If you would have the kindness to think of my
needs—"</span></div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00029.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And the little prince, completely
abashed, went to look for a sprinkling-can of fresh water. So, he
tended the flower.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;So, too, she began very quickly
to torment him with her vanity—which was, if the truth be known, a
little difficult to deal with. One day, for instance, when she was
speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Let the
tigers come with their claws!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"There are
no tigers on my planet,"</span> the little prince objected.
<span class="italic">"And, anyway, tigers do not eat
weeds."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I am not a
weed,"</span> the flower replied, sweetly.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Please
excuse me . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I am not at
all afraid of tigers,"</span> she went on, <span class=
"italic">"but I have a horror of drafts. I suppose you wouldn't
have a screen for me?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"A horror of
drafts—that is bad luck, for a plant,"</span> remarked the little
prince, and added to himself, <span class="italic">"This flower is
a very complex creature . . ."</span></div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00030.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"At night I
want you to put me under a glass globe. It is very cold where you
live. In the place I came from—"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But she interrupted herself at
that point. She had come in the form of a seed. She could not have
known anything of any other worlds. Embarassed over having let
herself be caught on the verge of such a naive untruth, she coughed
two or three times, in order to put the little prince in the
wrong.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"The
screen?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I was just
going to look for it when you spoke to me . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Then she forced her cough a
little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the
same.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;So the little prince, in spite of
all the good will that was inseparable from his love, had soon come
to doubt her. He had taken seriously words which were without
importance, and it made him very unhappy.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I ought not
to have listened to her,"</span> he confided to me one day.
<span class="italic">"One never ought to listen to the flowers. One
should simply look at them and breathe their fragrance. Mine
perfumed all my planet. But I did not know how to take pleasure in
all her grace. This tale of claws, which disturbed me so much,
should only have filled my heart with tenderness and
pity."</span></div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00031.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And he continued his
confidences:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"The fact is
that I did not know how to understand anything! I ought to have
judged by deeds and not by words. She cast her fragrance and her
radiance over me. I ought never to have run away from her . . . I
ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor
little stratagems. Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young
to know how to love her …"</span></div>
