<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;It was then that the fox
appeared.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;"Good morning," said the
fox.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;"Good morning," the little prince
responded politely, although when he turned around he saw
nothing.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;"I am right here," the voice
said, "under the apple tree."</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00057.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Who are
you?"</span> asked the little prince, and added, <span class=
"italic">"You are very pretty to look at."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I am a
fox,"</span> the fox said.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Come and
play with me,"</span> proposed the little prince. <span class=
"italic">"I am so unhappy."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I cannot
play with you,"</span> the fox said. <span class="italic">"I am not
tamed."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Ah! Please
excuse me,"</span> said the little prince.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But, after some thought, he
added:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"What does
that mean—'tame'?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"You do not
live here,"</span> said the fox. <span class="italic">"What is it
that you are looking for?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I am
looking for men,"</span> said the little prince. <span class=
"italic">"What does that mean—'tame'?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"Men,"</span> said the fox. <span class="italic">"They
have guns, and they hunt. It is very disturbing. They also raise
chickens. These are their only interests. Are you looking for
chickens?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"No,"</span>
said the little prince. <span class="italic">"I am looking for
friends. What does that mean—'tame'?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It is an
act too often neglected,"</span> said the fox. <span class=
"italic">"It means to establish ties."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"'To
establish ties'?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Just
that,"</span> said the fox. <span class="italic">"To me, you are
still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred
thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on
your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox
like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we
shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world.
To you, I shall be unique in all the world . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I am
beginning to understand,"</span> said the little prince.
<span class="italic">"There is a flower . . . I think that she has
tamed me . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It is
possible,"</span> said the fox. <span class="italic">"On the Earth
one sees all sorts of things."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Oh, but
this is not on the Earth!"</span> said the little prince.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The fox seemed perplexed, and
very curious.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"On another
planet?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"Yes."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Are there
hunters on that planet?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"No."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Ah, that is
interesting! Are there chickens?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"No."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Nothing is
perfect,"</span> sighed the fox.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But he came back to his
idea.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"My life is
very monotonous,"</span> the fox said. <span class="italic">"I hunt
chickens; men hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the
men are just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But
if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life.
I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all
the others. Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the
ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow. And then
look: you see the grain-fields down yonder? I do not eat bread.
Wheat is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to
me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the color of gold.
Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain,
which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. And I
shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The fox gazed at the little
prince, for a long time.</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00058.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Please—tame
me!"</span> he said.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I want to,
very much,"</span> the little prince replied. <span class=
"italic">"But I have not much time. I have friends to discover, and
a great many things to understand."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"One only
understands the things that one tames,"</span> said the fox.
<span class="italic">"Men have no more time to understand anything.
They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop
anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends
any more. If you want a friend, tame me . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"What must I
do, to tame you?"</span> asked the little prince.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"You must be
very patient,"</span> replied the fox. <span class="italic">"First
you will sit down at a little distance from me—like that—in the
grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you
will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But
you will sit a little closer to me, every day . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The next day the little prince
came back.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It would
have been better to come back at the same hour,"</span> said the
fox. <span class="italic">"If, for example, you come at four
o'clock in the afternoon, then at three o'clock I shall begin to be
happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At
four o'clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I
shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I
shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you
. . . One must observe the proper rites . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"What is a
rite?"</span> asked the little prince.</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00059.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Those also
are actions too often neglected,"</span> said the fox. <span class=
"italic">"They are what make one day different from other days, one
hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my
hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So
Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the
vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day
would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation
at all."</span></div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;So the little prince tamed the
fox. And when the hour of his departure drew near—</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Ah,"</span>
said the fox, <span class="italic">"I shall cry."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It is your
own fault,"</span> said the little prince. <span class="italic">"I
never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you .
. ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Yes, that
is so,"</span> said the fox.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"But now you
are going to cry!"</span> said the little prince.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Yes, that
is so,"</span> said the fox.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Then it has
done you no good at all!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It has done
me good,"</span> said the fox, <span class="italic">"because of the
color of the wheat fields."</span> And then he added:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Go and look
again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in
all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make
you a present of a secret."</span></div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The little prince went away, to
look again at the roses.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"You are not
at all like my rose,"</span> he said. <span class="italic">"As yet
you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one.
You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a
hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and
now he is unique in all the world."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And the roses were very much
embarrassed.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"You are
beautiful, but you are empty,"</span> he went on. <span class=
"italic">"One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary
passer-by would think that my rose looked just like you—the rose
that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than
all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have
watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe;
because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because
it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two
or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she
that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or ever
sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is <span class=
"italic">my</span> rose.</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And he went back to meet the
fox.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"Goodbye,"</span> he said.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"Goodbye,"</span> said the fox. <span class="italic">"And
now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the
heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to
the eye."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"What is
essential is invisible to the eye,"</span> the little prince
repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It is the
time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so
important."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It is the
time I have wasted for my rose—"</span> said the little prince, so
that he would be sure to remember.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Men have
forgotten this truth,"</span> said the fox. <span class=
"italic">"But you must not forget it. You become responsible,
forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose
. . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I am
responsible for my rose,"</span> the little prince repeated, so
that he would be sure to remember.</div>
