<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">

<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00045.jpg" class=

<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The sixth planet was ten times
larger than the last one. It was inhabited by an old gentleman who
wrote voluminous books.</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00046.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Oh, look!
Here is an explorer!"</span> he exclaimed to himself when he saw
the little prince coming.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The little prince sat down on the
table and panted a little. He had already traveled so much and so
far!</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Where do
you come from?"</span> the old gentleman said to him.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"What is
that big book?"</span> said the little prince. "What are you
doing?"</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I am a
geographer,"</span> said the old gentleman.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"What is a
geographer?"</span> asked the little prince.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"A
geographer is a scholar who knows the location of all the seas,
rivers, towns, mountains, and deserts."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"That is
very interesting,"</span> said the little prince. <span class=
"italic">"Here at last is a man who has a real profession!"</span>
And he cast a look around him at the planet of the geographer. It
was the most magnificent and stately planet that he had ever
seen.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Your planet
is very beautiful,"</span> he said. <span class="italic">"Has it
any oceans?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I couldn't
tell you,"</span> said the geographer.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Ah!"</span>
The little prince was disappointed. <span class="italic">"Has it
any mountains?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I couldn't
tell you,"</span> said the geographer.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"And towns,
and rivers, and deserts?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I couldn't
tell you that, either."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"But you are
a geographer!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"Exactly,"</span> the geographer said. <span class=
"italic">"But I am not an explorer. I haven't a single explorer on
my planet. It is not the geographer who goes out to count the
towns, the rivers, the mountains, the seas, the oceans, and the
deserts. The geographer is much too important to go loafing about.
He does not leave his desk. But he receives the explorers in his
study. He asks them questions, and he notes down what they recall
of their travels. And if the recollections of any one among them
seem interesting to him, the geographer orders an inquiry into that
explorer's moral character."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Why is
that?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Because an
explorer who told lies would bring disaster on the books of the
geographer. So would an explorer who drank too much."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Why is
that?"</span> asked the little prince.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Because
intoxicated men see double. Then the geographer would note down two
mountains in a place where there was only one."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I know some
one,"</span> said the little prince, <span class="italic">"who
would make a bad explorer."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"That is
possible. Then, when the moral character of the explorer is shown
to be good, an inquiry is ordered into his discovery."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"One goes to
see it?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"No. That
would be too complicated. But one requires the explorer to furnish
proofs. For example, if the discovery in question is that of a
large mountain, one requires that large stones be brought back from
it."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The geographer was suddenly
stirred to excitement.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"But you—you
come from far away! You are an explorer! You shall describe your
planet to me!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And, having opened his big
register, the geographer sharpened his pencil. The recitals of
explorers are put down first in pencil. One waits until the
explorer has furnished proofs, before putting them down in
ink.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"Well?"</span> said the geographer expectantly.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Oh, where I
live,"</span> said the little prince, <span class="italic">"it is
not very interesting. It is all so small. I have three volcanoes.
Two volcanoes are active and the other is extinct. But one never
knows."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"One never
knows,"</span> said the geographer.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I have also
a flower."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"We do not
record flowers,"</span> said the geographer.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Why is
that? The flower is the most beautiful thing on my
planet!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"We do not
record them,"</span> said the geographer, <span class=
"italic">"because they are ephemeral."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"What does
that mean—'ephemeral'?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"Geographies,"</span> said the geographer, <span class=
"italic">"are the books which, of all books, are most concerned
with matters of consequence. They never become old-fashioned. It is
very rarely that a mountain changes its position. It is very rarely
that an ocean empties itself of its waters. We write of eternal
things."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"But extinct
volcanoes may come to life again,"</span> the little prince
interrupted. <span class="italic">"What does that mean—
'ephemeral'?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Whether
volcanoes are extinct or alive, it comes to the same thing for
us,"</span> said the geographer. <span class="italic">"The thing
that matters to us is the mountain. It does not
change."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"But what
does that mean—'ephemeral'?"</span> repeated the little prince, who
never in his life had let go of a question, once he had asked
it.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It means,
'which is in danger of speedy disappearance.'"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Is my
flower in danger of speedy disappearance?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Certainly
it is."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"My flower
is ephemeral,"</span> the little prince said to himself,
<span class="italic">"and she has only four thorns to defend
herself against the world. And I have left her on my planet, all
alone!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;That was his first moment of
regret. But he took courage once more.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"What place
would you advise me to visit now?"</span> he asked.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"The planet
Earth,"</span> replied the geographer. <span class="italic">"It has
a good reputation."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And the little prince went away,
thinking of his flower</div>
