<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">

<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00065.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"Men,"</span> said the little prince, <span class=
"italic">"set out on their way in express trains, but they do not
know what they are looking for. Then they rush about, and get
excited, and turn round and round . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And he added:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It is not
worth the trouble . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The well that we had come to was
not like the wells of the Sahara. The wells of the Sahara are mere
holes dug in the sand. This one was like a well in a village. But
there was no village here, and I thought I must be dreaming . .
.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It is
strange,"</span> I said to the little prince. <span class=
"italic">"Everything is ready for use: the pulley, the bucket, the
rope . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;He laughed, touched the rope, and
set the pulley to working. And the pulley moaned, like an old
weathervane which the wind has long since forgotten.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Do you
hear?"</span> said the little prince. <span class="italic">"We have
wakened the well, and it is singing . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I did not want him to tire
himself with the rope.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Leave it to
me,"</span> I said. <span class="italic">"It is too heavy for
you."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I hoisted the bucket slowly to
the edge of the well and set it there—happy, tired as I was, over
my achievement. The song of the pulley was still in my ears, and I
could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trembling water.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I am
thirsty for this water,"</span> said the little prince.
<span class="italic">"Give me some of it to drink . .
."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And I understood what he had been
looking for.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I raised the bucket to his lips.
He drank, his eyes closed. It was as sweet as some special festival
treat. This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary
nourishment. Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars,
the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms. It was good for the
heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights of the
Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of
smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radiance of the gifts I
received.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"The men
where you live,"</span> said the little prince, <span class=
"italic">"raise five thousand roses in the same garden—and they do
not find in it what they are looking for."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"They do not
find it,"</span> I replied.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"And yet
what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in
a little water."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Yes, that
is true,"</span> I said.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And the little prince
added:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"But the
eyes are blind. One must look with the heart . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I had drunk the water. I breathed
easily. At sunrise the sand is the color of honey. And that honey
color was making me happy, too. What brought me, then, this sense
of grief?</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"You must
keep your promise,"</span> said the little prince, softly, as he
sat down beside me once more.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"What
promise?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"You know—a
muzzle for my sheep . . . I am responsible for this flower . .
."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I took my rough drafts of
drawings out of my pocket. The little prince looked them over, and
laughed as he said:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Your
baobabs—they look a little like cabbages."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"Oh!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I had been so proud of my
baobabs!</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Your
fox—his ears look a little like horns; and they are too
long."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And he laughed again.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"You are not
fair, little prince,"</span> I said. <span class="italic">"I don't
know how to draw anything except boa constrictors from the outside
and boa constrictors from the inside."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Oh, that
will be all right,"</span> he said, <span class="italic">"children
understand."</span></div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00066.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;So then I made a pencil sketch of
a muzzle. And as I gave it to him my heart was torn.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"You have
plans that I do not know about,"</span> I said.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But he did not answer me. He said
to me, instead:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"You know—my
descent to the earth . . . Tomorrow will be its
anniversary."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Then, after a silence, he went
on:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I came down
very near here."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And he flushed.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And once again, without
understanding why, I had a queer sense of sorrow. One question,
however, occurred to me:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Then it was
not by chance that on the morning when I first met you—a week
ago—you were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles
from any inhabited region? You were on the your back to the place
where you landed?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The little prince flushed
again.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And I added, with some
hesitancy:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Perhaps it
was because of the anniversary?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The little prince flushed once
more. He never answered questions—but when one flushes does that
not mean "Yes"?</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Ah,"</span>
I said to him, <span class="italic">"I am a little
frightened—"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But he interrupted me.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Now you
must work. You must return to your engine. I will be waiting for
you here. Come back tomorrow evening . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But I was not reassured. I
remembered the fox. One runs the risk of weeping a little, if one
lets himself be tamed . . .</div>
