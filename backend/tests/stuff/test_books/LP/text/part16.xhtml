<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The fourth planet belonged to a
businessman. This man was so much occupied that he did not even
raise his head at the little prince's arrival.</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00042.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Good
morning,"</span> the little prince said to him. <span class=
"italic">"Your cigarette has gone out."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Three and
two make five. Five and seven make twelve. Twelve and three make
fifteen. Good morning. FIfteen and seven make twenty-two.
Twenty-two and six make twenty-eight. I haven't time to light it
again. Twenty-six and five make thirty-one. Phew! Then that makes
five-hundred-and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two-thousand,
seven-hundred-thirty-one."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Five
hundred million what?"</span> asked the little prince.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Eh? Are you
still there? Five-hundred-and-one million—I can't stop . . . I have
so much to do! I am concerned with matters of consequence. I don't
amuse myself with balderdash. Two and five make seven . .
."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"Five-hundred-and-one million what?"</span> repeated the
little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question once
he had asked it.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The businessman raised his
head.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"During the
fifty-four years that I have inhabited this planet, I have been
disturbed only three times. The first time was twenty-two years
ago, when some giddy goose fell from goodness knows where. He made
the most frightful noise that resounded all over the place, and I
made four mistakes in my addition. The second time, eleven years
ago, I was disturbed by an attack of rheumatism. I don't get enough
exercise. I have no time for loafing. The third time—well, this is
it! I was saying, then, five-hundred-and-one
millions—"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Millions of
what?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The businessman suddenly realized
that there was no hope of being left in peace until he answered
this question.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Millions of
those little objects,"</span> he said, <span class="italic">"which
one sometimes sees in the sky."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"Flies?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Oh, no.
Little glittering objects."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"Bees?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Oh, no.
Little golden objects that set lazy men to idle dreaming. As for
me, I am concerned with matters of consequence. There is no time
for idle dreaming in my life."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Ah! You
mean the stars?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Yes, that's
it. The stars."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"And what do
you do with five-hundred millions of stars?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"Five-hundred-and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two
thousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one. I am concerned with matters of
consequence: I am accurate."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"And what do
you do with these stars?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"What do I
do with them?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"Yes."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Nothing. I
own them."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"You own the
stars?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"Yes."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"But I have
already seen a king who—"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Kings do
not own, they reign over. It is a very different
matter."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"And what
good does it do you to own the stars?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It does me
the good of making me rich."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"And what
good does it do you to be rich?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It makes it
possible for me to buy more stars, if any are
discovered."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"This
man,"</span> the little prince said to himself, <span class=
"italic">"reasons a little like my poor tippler . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, he still had some
more questions.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"How is it
possible for one to own the stars?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"To whom do
they belong?"</span> the businessman retorted, peevishly.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I don't
know. To nobody."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Then they
belong to me, because I was the first person to think of
it."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Is that all
that is necessary?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Certainly.
When you find a diamond that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When
you discover an island that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When
you get an idea before any one else, you take out a patent on it:
it is yours. So with me: I own the stars, because nobody else
before me ever thought of owning them."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Yes, that
is true," said the little prince. "And what do you do with
them?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I
administer them,"</span> replied the businessman. <span class=
"italic">"I count them and recount them. It is difficult. But I am
a man who is naturally interested in matters of
consequence."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The little prince was still not
satisfied.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"If I owned
a silk scarf,"</span> he said, <span class="italic">"I could put it
around my neck and take it away with me. If I owned a flower, I
could pluck that flower and take it away with me. But you cannot
pluck the stars from heaven . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"No. But I
can put them in the bank."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Whatever
does that mean?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"That means
that I write the number of my stars on a little paper. And then I
put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"And that is
all?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"That is
enough,"</span> said the businessman.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It is
entertaining,"</span> thought the little prince. <span class=
"italic">"It is rather poetic. But it is of no great
consequence."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;On matters of consequence, the
little prince had ideas which were very different from those of the
grown-ups.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I myself
own a flower,"</span> he continued his conversation with the
businessman, <span class="italic">"which I water every day. I own
three volcanoes, which I clean out every week (for I also clean out
the one that is extinct; one never knows). It is of some use to my
volcanoes, and it is of some use to my flower, that I own them. But
you are of no use to the stars . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The businessman opened his mouth,
but he found nothing to say in answer. And the little prince went
away.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"The
grown-ups are certainly altogether extraordinary,"</span> he said
simply, talking to himself as he continued on his journey.</div>
