<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The fifth planet was very
strange. It was the smallest of all. There was just enough room on
it for a street lamp and a lamplighter. The little prince was not
able to reach any explanation of the use of a street lamp and a
lamplighter, somewhere in the heavens, on a planet which had no
people, and not one house. But he said to himself,
nevertheless:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It may well
be that this man is absurd. But he is not so absurd as the king,
the conceited man, the businessman, and the tippler. For at least
his work has some meaning. When he lights his street lamp, it is as
if he brought one more star to life, or one flower. When he puts
out his lamp, he sends the flower, or the star, to sleep. That is a
beautiful occupation. And since it is beautiful, it is truly
useful."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;When he arrived on the planet he
respectfully saluted the lamplighter.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Good
morning. Why have you just put out your lamp?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Those are
the orders,"</span> replied the lamplighter. <span class=
"italic">"Good morning."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"What are
the orders?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"The orders
are that I put out my lamp. Good evening."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And he lighted his lamp
again.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"But why
have you just lighted it again?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Those are
the orders,"</span> replied the lamplighter.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I do not
understand,"</span> said the little prince.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"There is
nothing to understand,"</span> said the lamplighter. <span class=
"italic">"Orders are orders. Good morning."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And he put out his lamp.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Then he mopped his forehead with
a handkerchief decorated with red squares.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I follow a
terrible profession. In the old days it was reasonable. I put the
lamp out in the morning, and in the evening I lighted it again. I
had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the night
for sleep."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"And the
orders have been changed since that time?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"The orders
have not been changed,"</span> said the lamplighter. <span class=
"italic">"That is the tragedy! From year to year the planet has
turned more rapidly and the orders have not been
changed!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Then
what?"</span> asked the little prince.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Then—the
planet now makes a complete turn every minute, and I no longer have
a single second for repose. Once every minute I have to light my
lamp and put it out!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"That is
very funny! A day lasts only one minute, here where you
live!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It is not
funny at all!"</span> said the lamplighter. <span class=
"italic">"While we have been talking together a month has gone
by."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"A
month?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Yes, a
month. Thirty minutes. Thirty days. Good evening."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And he lighted his lamp
again.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;As the little prince watched him,
he felt that he loved this lamplighter who was so faithful to his
orders. He remembered the sunsets which he himself had gone to
seek, in other days, merely by pulling up his chair; and he wanted
to help his friend.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"You
know,"</span> he said, <span class="italic">"I can tell you a way
you can rest whenever you want to. . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I always
want to rest,"</span> said the lamplighter.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;For it is possible for a man to
be faithful and lazy at the same time.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The little prince went on with
his explanation:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Your planet
is so small that three strides will take you all the way around it.
To be always in the sunshine, you need only walk along rather
slowly. When you want to rest, you will walk—and the day will last
as long as you like."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"That
doesn't do me much good,"</span> said the lamplighter. <span class=
"italic">"The one thing I love in life is to sleep."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Then you're
unlucky,"</span> said the little prince.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I am
unlucky,"</span> said the lamplighter. <span class="italic">"Good
morning."</span></div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00044.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And he put out his lamp.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"That
man,"</span> said the little prince to himself, as he continued
farther on his journey, <span class="italic">"that man would be
scorned by all the others: by the king, by the conceited man, by
the tippler, by the businessman. Nevertheless he is the only one of
them all who does not seem to me ridiculous. Perhaps that is
because he is thinking of something else besides
himself."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;He breathed a sigh of regret, and
said to himself, again:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"That man is
the only one of them all whom I could have made my friend. But his
planet is indeed too small. There is no room on it for two people.
. ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;What the little prince did not
dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave this
planet, because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets!</div>
