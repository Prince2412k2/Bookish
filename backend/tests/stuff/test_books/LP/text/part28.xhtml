<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Beside the well there was the
ruin of an old stone wall. When I came back from my work, the next
evening, I saw from some distance away my little price sitting on
top of a wall, with his feet dangling. And I heard him say:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Then you
don't remember. This is not the exact spot."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Another voice must have answered
him, for he replied to it:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Yes, yes!
It is the right day, but this is not the place."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I continued my walk toward the
wall. At no time did I see or hear anyone. The little prince,
however, replied once again:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"—Exactly.
You will see where my track begins, in the sand. You have nothing
to do but wait for me there. I shall be there
tonight."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I was only twenty meters from the
wall, and I still saw nothing.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;After a silence the little prince
spoke again:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"You have
good poison? You are sure that it will not make me suffer too
long?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I stopped in my tracks, my heart
torn asunder; but still I did not understand.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Now go
away,"</span> said the little prince. <span class="italic">"I want
to get down from the wall."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I dropped my eyes, then, to the
foot of the wall—and I leaped into the air. There before me, facing
the little prince, was one of those yellow snakes that take just
thirty seconds to bring your life to an end. Even as I was digging
into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back.
But, at the noise I made, the snake let himself flow easily across
the sand like the dying spray of a fountain, and, in no apparent
hurry, disappeared, with a light metallic sound, among the
stones.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I reached the wall just in time
to catch my little man in my arms; his face was white as
snow.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"What does
this mean?"</span> I demanded. <span class="italic">"Why are you
talking with snakes?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I had loosened the golden muffler
that he always wore. I had moistened his temples, and had given him
some water to drink. And now I did not dare ask him any more
questions. He looked at me very gravely, and put his arms around my
neck. I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird, shot
with someone's rifle . . .</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I am glad
that you have found what was the matter with your engine,"</span>
he said. <span class="italic">"Now you can go back
home—"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"How do you
know about that?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I was just coming to tell him
that my work had been successful, beyond anything that I had dared
to hope.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;He made no answer to my question,
but he added:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I, too, am
going back home today . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Then, sadly—</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It is much
farther . . . It is much more difficult . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I realized clearly that something
extraordinary was happening. I was holding him close in my arms as
if he were a little child; and yet it seemed to me that he was
rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing to
restrain him . . .</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;His look was very serious, like
some one lost far away.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I have your
sheep. And I have the sheep's box. And I have the muzzle . .
."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And he gave me a sad smile.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I waited a long time. I could see
that he was reviving little by little.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Dear little
man,"</span> I said to him, <span class="italic">"you are afraid .
. ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;He was afraid, there was no doubt
about that. But he laughed lightly.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I shall be
much more afraid this evening . . ."</span></div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00068.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Once again I felt myself frozen
by the sense of something irreparable. And I knew that I could not
bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more. For me,
it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Little
man,"</span> I said, <span class="italic">"I want to hear you laugh
again."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But he said to me:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Tonight, it
will be a year . . . My star, then, can be found right above the
place where I came to the Earth, a year ago . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Little
man,"</span> I said, <span class="italic">"tell me that it is only
a bad dream—this affair of the snake, and the meeting-place, and
the star . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But he did not answer my plea. He
said to me, instead:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"The thing
that is important is the thing that is not seen . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Yes, I know
. . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It is just
as it is with the flower. If you love a flower that lives on a
star, it is sweet to look at the sky at night. All the stars are
a-bloom with flowers . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Yes, I know
. . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It is just
as it is with the water. Because of the pulley, and the rope, what
you gave me to drink was like music. You remember—how good it
was."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Yes, I know
. . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"And at
night you will look up at the stars. Where I live everything is so
small that I cannot show you where my star is to be found. It is
better, like that. My star will just be one of the stars, for you.
And so you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens . . .
they will all be your friends. And, besides, I am going to make you
a present . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;He laughed again.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Ah, little
prince, dear little prince! I love to hear that
laughter!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"That is my
present. Just that. It will be as it was when we drank the water .
. ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"What are
you trying to say?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"All men
have the stars,"</span> he answered, <span class="italic">"but they
are not the same things for different people. For some, who are
travelers, the stars are guides. For others they are no more than
little lights in the sky. For others, who are scholars, they are
problems. For my businessman they were wealth. But all these stars
are silent. You—you alone—will have the stars as no one else has
them—"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"What are
you trying to say?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"In one of
the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing.
And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look
at the sky at night . . . You—only you—will have stars that can
laugh!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And he laughed again.</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00069.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"And when
your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be
content that you have known me. You will always be my friend. You
will want to laugh with me. And you will sometimes open your
window, so, for that pleasure . . . And your friends will be
properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky!
Then you will say to them, 'Yes, the stars always make me laugh!'
And they will think you are crazy. It will be a very shabby trick
that I shall have played on you . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And he laughed again.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It will be
as if, in place of the stars, I had given you a great number of
little bells that knew how to laugh . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And he laughed again. Then he
quickly became serious:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Tonight—you
know . . . Do not come."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I shall not
leave you,"</span> I said.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I shall
look as if I were suffering. I shall look a little as if I were
dying. It is like that. Do not come to see that. It is not worth
the trouble . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I shall not
leave you."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But he was worried.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I tell
you—it is also because of the snake. He must not bite you.
Snakes—they are malicious creatures. This one might bite you just
for fun . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I shall not
leave you."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But a thought came to reassure
him:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It is true
that they have no more poison for a second bite."</span></div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00070.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;That night I did not see him set
out on his way. He got away from me without making a sound. When I
succeeded in catching up with him he was walking along with a quick
and resolute step. He said to me merely:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Ah! You are
there . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And he took me by the hand. But
he was still worrying.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It was
wrong of you to come. You will suffer. I shall look as if I were
dead; and that will not be true . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I said nothing.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"You
understand . . . it is too far. I cannot carry this body with me.
It is too heavy."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I said nothing.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"But it will
be like an old abandoned shell. There is nothing sad about old
shells . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I said nothing.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;He was a little discouraged. But
he made one more effort:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"You know,
it will be very nice. I, too, shall look at the stars. All the
stars will be wells with a rusty pulley. All the stars will pour
out fresh water for me to drink . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I said nothing.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"That will
be so amusing! You will have five hundred million little bells, and
I shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water . .
."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And he too said nothing more,
because he was crying . . .</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Here it is.
Let me go on by myself."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And he sat down, because he was
afraid. Then he said, again:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"You know—my
flower . . . I am responsible for her. And she is so weak! She is
so naive! She has four thorns, of no use at all, to protect herself
against all the world . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I too sat down, because I was not
able to stand up any longer.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"There
now—that is all . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;He still hesitated a little; then
he got up. He took one step. I could not move.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;There was nothing but a flash of
yellow close to his ankle. He remained motionless for an instant.
He did not cry out. He fell as gently as a tree falls. There was
not even any sound, because of the sand.</div>
