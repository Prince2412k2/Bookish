<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00019.jpg" class=

<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;As each day passed I would learn,
in our talk, something about the little prince's planet, his
departure from it, his journey. The information would come very
slowly, as it might chance to fall from his thoughts. It was in
this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe of
the baobabs.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;This time, once more, I had the
sheep to thank for it. For the little prince asked me abruptly—as
if seized by a grave doubt—<span class="italic">"It is true, isn't
it, that sheep eat little bushes?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Yes, that
is true."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Ah! I am
glad!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I did not understand why it was
so important that sheep should eat little bushes. But the little
prince added:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Then it
follows that they also eat baobabs?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I pointed out to the little
prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary,
trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole herd of
elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single
baobab.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The idea of the herd of elephants
made the little prince laugh.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"We would
have to put them one on top of the other,"</span> he said.</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00020.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But he made a wise comment:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Before they
grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"That is
strictly correct," I said. "But why do you want the sheep to eat
the little baobabs?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;He answered me at once,
<span class="italic">"Oh, come, come!"</span>, as if he were
speaking of something that was self-evident. And I was obliged to
make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any
assistance.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Indeed, as I learned, there were
on the planet where the little prince lived—as on all planets—good
plants and bad plants. In consequence, there were good seeds from
good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants. But seeds are
invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of the earth's darkness,
until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken. Then
this little seed will stretch itself and begin—timidly at first—to
push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun.
If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one
would let it grow wherever it might wish. But when it is a bad
plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first
instant that one recognizes it.</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00021.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Now there were some terrible
seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and
these were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of that planet was
infested with them. A baobab is something you will never, never be
able to get rid of if you attend to it too late. It spreads over
the entire planet. It bores clear through it with its roots. And if
the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split
it in pieces . . .</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It is a
question of discipline,"</span> the little prince said to me later
on. <span class="italic">"When you've finished your own toilet in
the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your
planet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see to it that
you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment
when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they
resemble so closely in their earliest youth. It is very tedious
work,"</span> the little prince added, <span class="italic">"but
very easy."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And one day he said to me:
<span class="italic">"You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so
that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is.
That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day.
Sometimes,"</span> he added, <span class="italic">"there is no harm
in putting off a piece of work until another day. But when it is a
matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe. I knew a planet
that was inhabited by a lazy man. He neglected three little bushes
. . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;So, as the little prince
described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not
much like to take the tone of a moralist. But the danger of the
baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would
be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I
am breaking through my reserve. <span class="italic">"Children," I
say plainly, "watch out for the baobabs!"</span></div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00022.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;My friends, like myself, have
been skirting this danger for a long time, without ever knowing it;
and so it is for them that I have worked so hard over this drawing.
The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble
it has cost me. Perhaps you will ask me, <span class="italic">"Why
are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and
impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The reply is simple. I have
tried. But with the others I have not been successful. When I made
the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the
inspiring force of urgent necessity.</div>
