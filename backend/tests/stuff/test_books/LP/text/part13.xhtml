<div>
<div class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9"><span class=

<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;.</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00035.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;He found himself in the
neighborhood of the asteroids 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, and 330. He
began, therefore, by visiting them, in order to add to his
knowledge.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The first of them was inhabited
by a king. Clad in royal purple and ermine, he was seated upon a
throne which was at the same time both simple and majestic.</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00036.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Ah! Here is
a subject,"</span> exclaimed the king, when he saw the little
prince coming.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And the little prince asked
himself:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"How could
he recognize me when he had never seen me before?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;He did not know how the world is
simplified for kings. To them, all men are subjects.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Approach,
so that I may see you better,"</span> said the king, who felt
consumingly proud of being at last a king over somebody.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The little prince looked
everywhere to find a place to sit down; but the entire planet was
crammed and obstructed by the king's magnificent ermine robe. So he
remained standing upright, and, since he was tired, he
yawned.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It is
contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king,"</span>
the monarch said to him. <span class="italic">"I forbid you to do
so."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I can't
help it. I can't stop myself,"</span> replied the little prince,
thoroughly embarrassed. <span class="italic">"I have come on a long
journey, and I have had no sleep . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Ah,
then,"</span> the king said. <span class="italic">"I order you to
yawn. It is years since I have seen anyone yawning. Yawns, to me,
are objects of curiosity. Come, now! Yawn again! It is an
order."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"That
frightens me . . . I cannot, any more . . ."</span> murmured the
little prince, now completely abashed.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Hum!
Hum!"</span> replied the king. <span class="italic">"Then I—I order
you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to—"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;He sputtered a little, and seemed
vexed.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;For what the king fundamentally
insisted upon was that his authority should be respected. He
tolerated no disobedience. He was an absolute monarch. But, because
he was a very good man, he made his orders reasonable.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"If I
ordered a general,"</span> he would say, by way of example,
<span class="italic">"if I ordered a general to change himself into
a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be
the fault of the general. It would be my fault."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"May I sit
down?"</span> came now a timid inquiry from the little
prince.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I order you
to do so,"</span> the king answered him, and majestically gathered
in a fold of his ermine mantle.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But the little prince was
wondering . . . The planet was tiny. Over what could this king
really rule?</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"Sire,"</span> he said to him, <span class="italic">"I beg
that you will excuse my asking you a question—"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I order you
to ask me a question,"</span> the king hastened to assure
him.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Sire—over
what do you rule?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Over
everything,"</span> said the king, with magnificent
simplicity.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Over
everything?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The king made a gesture, which
took in his planet, the other planets, and all the stars.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Over all
that?"</span> asked the little prince.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Over all
that,"</span> the king answered.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;For his rule was not only
absolute: it was also universal.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"And the
stars obey you?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Certainly
they do,"</span> the king said. <span class="italic">"They obey
instantly. I do not permit insubordination."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Such power was a thing for the
little prince to marvel at. If he had been master of such complete
authority, he would have been able to watch the sunset, not
forty-four times in one day, but seventy-two, or even a hundred, or
even two hundred times, without ever having to move his chair. And
because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet which
he had forsaken, he plucked up his courage to ask the king a
favor:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I should
like to see a sunset . . . Do me that kindness . . . Order the sun
to set . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"If I
ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a
butterfly, or to write a tragic drama, or to change himself into a
sea bird, and if the general did not carry out the order that he
had received, which one of us would be in the wrong?"</span> the
king demanded. <span class="italic">"The general, or
myself?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"You,"</span> said the little prince firmly.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Exactly.
One must require from each one the duty which each one can
perform,"</span> the king went on. <span class="italic">"Accepted
authority rests first of all on reason. If you ordered your people
to go and throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in
revolution. I have the right to require obedience because my orders
are reasonable."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Then my
sunset?"</span> the little prince reminded him: for he never forgot
a question once he had asked it.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"You shall
have your sunset. I shall command it. But, according to my science
of government, I shall wait until conditions are
favorable."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"When will
that be?"</span> inquired the little prince.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Hum!
Hum!"</span> replied the king; and before saying anything else he
consulted a bulky almanac. <span class="italic">"Hum! Hum! That
will be about—about—that will be this evening about twenty minutes
to eight. And you will see how well I am obeyed!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The little prince yawned. He was
regretting his lost sunset. And then, too, he was already beginning
to be a little bored.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I have
nothing more to do here,"</span> he said to the king. <span class=
"italic">"So I shall set out on my way again."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Do not
go,"</span> said the king, who was very proud of having a subject.
<span class="italic">"Do not go. I will make you a
Minister!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Minister of
what?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Minster
of—of Justice!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"But there
is nobody here to judge!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"We do not
know that,"</span> the king said to him. <span class="italic">"I
have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom. I am very old.
There is no room here for a carriage. And it tires me to
walk."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Oh, but I
have looked already!"</span> said the little prince, turning around
to give one more glance to the other side of the planet. On that
side, as on this, there was nobody at all . . .</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Then you
shall judge yourself,"</span> the king answered. <span class=
"italic">"that is the most difficult thing of all. It is much more
difficult to judge oneself than to judge others. If you succeed in
judging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true
wisdom."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"Yes,"</span> said the little prince, <span class=
"italic">"but I can judge myself anywhere. I do not need to live on
this planet."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Hum!
Hum!"</span> said the king. <span class="italic">"I have good
reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat.
I hear him at night. You can judge this old rat. From time to time
you will condemn him to death. Thus his life will depend on your
justice. But you will pardon him on each occasion; for he must be
treated thriftily. He is the only one we have."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I,"</span>
replied the little prince, <span class="italic">"do not like to
condemn anyone to death. And now I think I will go on my
way."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"No,"</span>
said the king.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But the little prince, having now
completed his preparations for departure, had no wish to grieve the
old monarch.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"If Your
Majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed,"</span> he said, <span class=
"italic">"he should be able to give me a reasonable order. He
should be able, for example, to order me to be gone by the end of
one minute. It seems to me that conditions are favorable . .
."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;As the king made no answer, the
little prince hesitated a moment. Then, with a sigh, he took his
leave.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I make you
my Ambassador,"</span> the king called out, hastily.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;He had a magnificent air of
authority.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"The
grown-ups are very strange,"</span> the little prince said to
himself, as he continued on his journey.</div>
