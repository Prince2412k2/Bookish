<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00064.jpg" class=

<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;It was now the eighth day since I
had had my accident in the desert, and I had listened to the story
of the merchant as I was drinking the last drop of my water
supply.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Ah,"</span>
I said to the little prince, <span class="italic">"these memories
of yours are very charming; but I have not yet succeeded in
repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too,
should be very happy if I could walk at my leisure toward a spring
of fresh water!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"My friend
the fox—"</span> the little prince said to me.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"My dear
little man, this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with
the fox!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Why
not?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Because I
am about to die of thirst . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;He did not follow my reasoning,
and he answered me:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It is a
good thing to have had a friend, even if one is about to die. I,
for instance, am very glad to have had a fox as a friend . .
."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"He has no
way of guessing the danger,"</span> I said to myself. <span class=
"italic">"He has never been either hungry or thirsty. A little
sunshine is all he needs . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But he looked at me steadily, and
replied to my thought:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I am
thirsty, too. Let us look for a well . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I made a gesture of weariness. It
is absurd to look for a well, at random, in the immensity of the
desert. But nevertheless we started walking.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;When we had trudged along for
several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began
to come out. Thirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at
them as if I were in a dream. The little prince's last words came
reeling back into my memory:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Then you
are thirsty, too?"</span> I demanded.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But he did not reply to my
question. He merely said to me:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Water may
also be good for the heart . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I did not understand this answer,
but I said nothing. I knew very well that it was impossible to
cross-examine him.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;He was tired. He sat down. I sat
down beside him. And, after a little silence, he spoke again:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"The stars
are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be
seen."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I replied, <span class=
"italic">"Yes, that is so."</span> And, without saying anything
more, I looked across the ridges of sand that were stretched out
before us in the moonlight.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"The desert
is beautiful,"</span> the little prince added.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And that was true. I have always
loved the desert. One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees
nothing, hears nothing. Yet through the silence something throbs,
and gleams . . .</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"What makes
the desert beautiful,"</span> said the little prince, <span class=
"italic">"is that somewhere it hides a well . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I was astonished by a sudden
understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands. When I was
a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a
treasure was buried there. To be sure, no one had ever known how to
find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an
enchantment over that house. My home was hiding a secret in the
depths of its heart . . .</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"Yes,"</span> I said to the little prince. <span class=
"italic">"The house, the stars, the desert—what gives them their
beauty is something that is invisible!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I am
glad,"</span> he said, <span class="italic">"that you agree with my
fox."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;As the little prince dropped off
to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I
felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying
a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was
nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his
pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in
the wind, and I said to myself: <span class="italic">"What I see
here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible .
. ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;As his lips opened slightly with
the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:
<span class="italic">"What moves me so deeply, about this little
prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower—the image
of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a
lamp, even when he is asleep . . ."</span> And I felt him to be
more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he
himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of
wind . . .</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And, as I walked on so, I found
the well, at daybreak.</div>
