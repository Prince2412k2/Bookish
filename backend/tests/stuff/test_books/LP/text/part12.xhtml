<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00033.jpg" class=

<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I believe that for his escape he
took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds. On the
morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order. He
carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes. He possessed two active
volcanoes; and they were very convenient for heating his breakfast
in the morning. He also had one volcano that was extinct. But, as
he said, <span class="italic">"One never knows!"</span> So he
cleaned out the extinct volcano, too. If they are well cleaned out,
volcanoes burn slowly and steadily, without any eruptions. Volcanic
eruptions are like fires in a chimney.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;On our earth we are obviously
much too small to clean out our volcanoes. That is why they bring
no end of trouble upon us.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The little prince also pulled up,
with a certain sense of dejection, the last little shoots of the
baobabs. He believed that he would never want to return. But on
this last morning all these familiar tasks seemed very precious to
him. And when he watered the flower for the last time, and prepared
to place her under the shelter of her glass globe, he realized that
he was very close to tears.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"Goodbye,"</span> he said to the flower.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But she made no answer.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"Goodbye,"</span> he said again.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The flower coughed. But it was
not because she had a cold.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I have been
silly,"</span> she said to him, at last. <span class="italic">"I
ask your forgiveness. Try to be happy . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;He was surprised by this absence
of reproaches. He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held
arrested in mid-air. He did not understand this quiet
sweetness.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Of course I
love you,"</span> the flower said to him. <span class="italic">"It
is my fault that you have not known it all the while. That is of no
importance. But you—you have been just as foolish as I. Try to be
happy . . . Let the glass globe be. I don't want it any
more."</span></div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00034.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"But the
wind—"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"My cold is
not so bad as all that . . . The cool night air will do me good. I
am a flower."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"But the
animals—"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Well, I
must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to
become acquainted with the butterflies. It seems that they are very
beautiful. And if not the butterflies—and the caterpillars—who will
call upon me? You will be far away . . . As for the large animals—I
am not at all afraid of any of them. I have my claws."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And, naively, she showed her four
thorns. Then she added:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Don't
linger like this. You have decided to go away. Now
go!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;For she did not want him to see
her crying. She was such a proud flower.</div>
