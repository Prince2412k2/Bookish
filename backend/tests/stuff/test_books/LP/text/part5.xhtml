<body>
<div>
<div class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9"><span class=
"bold">2.</span></span></div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00006.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;So I lived my life alone, without
anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my
plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken
in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any
passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all
alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely
enough drinking water to last a week.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The first night, then, I went to
sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I
was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle
of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I
was awakened by an odd little voice. It said:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"If you
please—draw me a sheep!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"What!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Draw me a
sheep!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I jumped to my feet, completely
thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard. I looked carefully all
around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood
there examining me with great seriousness. Here you may see the
best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But my
drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00007.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;That, however, is not my fault.
The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six
years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from
the outside and boas from the inside.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Now I stared at this sudden
apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in
astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand
miles from any inhabited region. And yet my little man seemed
neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be
fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing about
him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the
desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation. When at last I
was able to speak, I said to him:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"But—what
are you doing here?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And in answer he repeated, very
slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great
consequence:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"If you
please—draw me a sheep . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;When a mystery is too
overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it might seem to me,
a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death,
I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen. But
then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on
geography, history, arithmetic and grammar, and I told the little
chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw. He
answered me:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"That
doesn't matter. Draw me a sheep . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But I had never drawn a sheep. So
I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often. It was
that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded
to hear the little fellow greet it with:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"No, no, no!
I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa
constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very
cumbersome. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is
a sheep. Draw me a sheep."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;So then I made a drawing.</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00008.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;He looked at it carefully, then
he said:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"No. This
sheep is already very sickly. Make me another."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;So I made another drawing.</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00009.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;My friend smiled gently and
indulgently.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"You see
yourself,"</span> he said, <span class="italic">"that this is not a
sheep. This is a ram. It has horns."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;So then I did my drawing over
once more.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But it was rejected too, just
like the others.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"This one is
too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time."</span></div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00010.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;By this time my patience was
exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine
apart. So I tossed off this drawing.</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00011.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And I threw out an explanation
with it.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"This is
only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I was very surprised to see a
light break over the face of my young judge:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"That is
exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have
to have a great deal of grass?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"Why?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Because
where I live everything is very small . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"There will
surely be enough grass for him," I said. "It is a very small sheep
that I have given you."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;He bent his head over the
drawing.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Not so
small that—Look! He has gone to sleep . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And that is how I made the
acquaintance of the little prince.</div>
