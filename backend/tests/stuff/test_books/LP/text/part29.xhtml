<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And now six years have already
gone by . . . I have never yet told this story. The companions who
met me on my return were well content to see me alive. I was sad,
but I told them: <span class="italic">"I am tired."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Now my sorrow is comforted a
little. That is to say—not entirely. But I know that he did go back
to his planet, because I did not find his body at daybreak. It was
not such a heavy body . . . and at night I love to listen to the
stars. It is like five hundred million little bells . . .</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But there is one extraordinary
thing . . . when I drew the muzzle for the little prince, I forgot
to add the leather strap to it. He will never have been able to
fasten it on his sheep. So now I keep wondering: what is happening
on his planet? Perhaps the sheep has eaten the flower . . .</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;At one time I say to myself:
<span class="italic">"Surely not! The little prince shuts his
flower under her glass globe every night, and he watches over his
sheep very carefully . . ."</span> Then I am happy. And there is
sweetness in the laughter of all the stars.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But at another time I say to
myself: <span class="italic">"At some moment or other one is
absent-minded, and that is enough! On some one evening he forgot
the glass globe, or the sheep got out, without making any noise, in
the night . . ."</span> And then the little bells are changed to
tears . . .</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Here, then, is a great mystery.
For you who also love the little prince, and for me, nothing in the
universe can be the same if somewhere, we do not know where, a
sheep that we never saw has—yes or no?--eaten a rose . . .</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Look up at the sky. Ask
yourselves: is it yes or no? Has the sheep eaten the flower? And
you will see how everything changes . . .</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And no grown-up will ever
understand that this is a matter of so much importance!</div>

<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">This is, to
me, the loveliest and saddest landscape in the world. It is the
same as that on the preceding page, but I have drawn it again to
impress it on your memory. It is here that the little prince
appeared on Earth, and disappeared.</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">Look at it
carefully so that you will be sure to recognize it in case you
travel some day to the African desert. And, if you should come upon
this spot, please do not hurry on. Wait for a time, exactly under
the star. Then, if a little man appears who laughs, who has golden
hair and who refuses to answer questions, you will know who he is.
If this should happen, please comfort me. Send me word that he has
come back.</span></div>
