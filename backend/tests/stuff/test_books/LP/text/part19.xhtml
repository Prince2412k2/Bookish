<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">

<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00047.jpg" class=

<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;So then the seventh planet was
the Earth.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The Earth is not just an ordinary
planet! One can count, there, 111 kings (not forgetting, to be
sure, the Negro kings among them), 7000 geographers, 900,000
businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men—that is
to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;To give you an idea of the size
of the Earth, I will tell you that before the invention of
electricity it was necessary to maintain, over the whole of the six
continents, a veritable army of 462,511 lamplighters for the street
lamps.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Seen from a slight distance, that
would make a splendid spectacle. The movements of this army would
be regulated like those of the ballet in the opera. First would
come the turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia.
Having set their lamps alight, these would go off to sleep. Next,
the lamplighters of China and Siberia would enter for their steps
in the dance, and then they too would be waved back into the wings.
After that would come the turn of the lamplighters of Russia and
the Indies; then those of Africa and Europe; then those of South
America; then those of South America; then those of North America.
And never would they make a mistake in the order of their entry
upon the stage. It would be magnificent.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Only the man who was in charge of
the single lamp at the North Pole, and his colleague who was
responsible for the single lamp at the South Pole—only these two
would live free from toil and care: they would be busy twice a
year.</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9"><span class=
"bold">17.</span></span></div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00048.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;When one wishes to play the wit,
he sometimes wanders a little from the truth. I have not been
altogether honest in what I have told you about the lamplighters.
And I realize that I run the risk of giving a false idea of our
planet to those who do not know it. Men occupy a very small place
upon the Earth. If the two billion inhabitants who people its
surface were all to stand upright and somewhat crowded together, as
they do for some big public assembly, they could easily be put into
one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide. All
humanity could be piled up on a small Pacific islet.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The grown-ups, to be sure, will
not believe you when you tell them that. They imagine that they
fill a great deal of space. They fancy themselves as important as
the baobabs. You should advise them, then, to make their own
calculations. They adore figures, and that will please them. But do
not waste your time on this extra task. It is unnecessary. You
have, I know, confidence in me.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;When the little prince arrived on
the Earth, he was very much surprised not to see any people. He was
beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil
of gold, the color of the moonlight, flashed across the sand.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Good
evening,"</span> said the little prince courteously.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Good
evening,"</span> said the snake.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"What planet
is this on which I have come down?"</span> asked the little
prince.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"This is the
Earth; this is Africa,"</span> the snake answered.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Ah! Then
there are no people on the Earth?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"This is the
desert. There are no people in the desert. The Earth is
large,"</span> said the snake.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The little prince sat down on a
stone, and raised his eyes toward the sky.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I
wonder,"</span> he said, <span class="italic">"whether the stars
are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us may find
his own again . . . Look at my planet. It is right there above us.
But how far away it is!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It is
beautiful,"</span> the snake said. <span class="italic">"What has
brought you here?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I have been
having some trouble with a flower,"</span> said the little
prince.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Ah!"</span>
said the snake.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And they were both silent.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Where are
the men?"</span> the little prince at last took up the conversation
again. <span class="italic">"It is a little lonely in the desert .
. ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"It is also
lonely among men,"</span> the snake said.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The little prince gazed at him
for a long time.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"You are a
funny animal,"</span> he said at last. <span class="italic">"You
are no thicker than a finger . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"But I am
more powerful than the finger of a king,"</span> said the
snake.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The little prince smiled.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"You are not
very powerful. You haven't even any feet. You cannot even travel .
. ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I can carry
you farther than any ship could take you,"</span> said the
snake.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;He twined himself around the
little prince's ankle, like a golden bracelet.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Whomever I
touch, I send back to the earth from whence he came,"</span> the
snake spoke again. <span class="italic">"But you are innocent and
true, and you come from a star . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The little prince made no
reply.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"You move me
to pity—you are so weak on this Earth made of granite,"</span> the
snake said. <span class="italic">"I can help you, some day, if you
grow too homesick for your own planet. I can—"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Oh! I
understand you very well,"</span> said the little prince.
<span class="italic">"But why do you always speak in
riddles?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I solve
them all,"</span> said the snake.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;And they were both silent.</div>
