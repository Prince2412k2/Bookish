<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00002.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Once when I was six years old I
saw a magnificent picture in a book, called <span class=
"italic">True Stories from Nature</span>, about the primeval
forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of
swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00003.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;In the book it said: <span class=
"italic">"Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without
chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep
through the six months that they need for digestion."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I pondered deeply, then, over the
adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil
I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It
looked something like this:</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00004.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I showed my masterpiece to the
grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened
them.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But they answered: <span class=
"italic">"Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a
hat?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;My drawing was not a picture of a
hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant.
But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made
another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa constrictor, so that
the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things
explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this:</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00005.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The grown-ups' response, this
time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa
constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote
myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That
is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a
magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the
failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two.
Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is
tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to
them.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;So then I chose another
profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have flown a little
over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been
very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from
Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is
valuable.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;In the course of this life I have
had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been
concerned with matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal
among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately, close at hand. And
that hasn't much improved my opinion of them.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Whenever I met one of them who
seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of
showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I
would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true
understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always
say:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"That is a
hat."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Then I would never talk to that
person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I
would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about
bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the grown-up
would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.</div>
