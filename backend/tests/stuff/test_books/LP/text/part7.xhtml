<div class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9"><span class=

<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">

<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">

<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00015.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I had thus learned a second fact
of great importance: this was that the planet the little prince
came from was scarcely any larger than a house!</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But that did not really surprise
me much. I knew very well that in addition to the great
planets—such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus—to which we have
given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are
so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the
telescope. When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not
give it a name, but only a number. He might call it, for example,
<span class="italic">"Asteroid 325"</span>.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I have serious reason to believe
that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid
known as B-612.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;This asteroid has only once been
seen through the telescope. That was by a Turkish astronomer, in
1909.</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;On making his discovery, the
astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical
Congress, in a great demonstration. But he was in Turkish costume,
and so nobody would believe what he said.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Grown-ups are like that . .
.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Fortunately, however, for the
reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that
his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European
costume. So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over
again, dressed with impressive style and elegance. And this time
everybody accepted his report.</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;If I have told you these details
about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on
account of the grown-ups and their ways. When you tell them that
you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about
essential matters. They never say to you, <span class=
"italic">"What does his voice sound like? What games does he love
best? Does he collect butterflies?"</span> Instead, they demand:
<span class="italic">"How old is he? How many brothers has he? How
much does he weigh? How much money does his father make?"</span>
Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything
about him.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;If you were to say to the
grown-ups: <span class="italic">"I saw a beautiful house made of
rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the
roof,"</span> they would not be able to get any idea of that house
at all. You would have to say to them: <span class="italic">"I saw
a house that cost $20,000."</span> Then they would exclaim:
<span class="italic">"Oh, what a pretty house that
is!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;Just so, you might say to them:
<span class="italic">"The proof that the little prince existed is
that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for
a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he
exists."</span> And what good would it do to tell them that? They
would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child. But if you
said to them: <span class="italic">"The planet he came from is
Asteroid B-612,"</span> then they would be convinced, and leave you
in peace from their questions.</div>
<p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">
&#160;</p>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpg" class=
"calibre7" /></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;They are like that. One must not
hold it against them. Children should always show great forbearance
toward grown-up people.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;But certainly, for us who
understand life, figures are a matter of indifference. I should
have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tales. I
should have like to say: <span class="italic">"Once upon a time
there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely
any bigger than himself, and who had need of a sheep . .
."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;To those who understand life,
that would have given a much greater air of truth to my
story.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;For I do not want any one to read
my book carelessly. I have suffered too much grief in setting down
these memories. Six years have already passed since my friend went
away from me, with his sheep. If I try to describe him here, it is
to make sure that I shall not forget him. To forget a friend is
sad. Not every one has had a friend. And if I forget him, I may
become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything
but figures . . .</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;It is for that purpose, again,
that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils. It is hard to
take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any
pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and
the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six. I shall
certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible. But
I am not at all sure of success. One drawing goes along all right,
and another has no resemblance to its subject. I make some errors,
too, in the little prince's height: in one place he is too tall and
in another too short. And I feel some doubts about the color of his
costume. So I fumble along as best I can, now good, now bad, and I
hope generally fair-to-middling.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;In certain more important details
I shall make mistakes, also. But that is something that will not be
my fault. My friend never explained anything to me. He thought,
perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know how to
see sheep through the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like
the grown-ups. I have had to grow old.</div>
