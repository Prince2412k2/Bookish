<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;On the fifth day—again, as
always, it was thanks to the sheep—the secret of the little
prince's life was revealed to me. Abruptly, without anything to
lead up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and
silent meditation on his problem, he demanded:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"A sheep—if
it eats little bushes, does it eat flowers, too?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"A
sheep,"</span> I answered, <span class="italic">"eats anything it
finds in its reach."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Even
flowers that have thorns?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Yes, even
flowers that have thorns."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Then the
thorns—what use are they?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I did not know. At that moment I
was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my
engine. I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me
that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious. And I had so
little drinking-water left that I had to fear for the worst.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"The
thorns—what use are they?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The little prince never let go of
a question, once he had asked it. As for me, I was upset over that
bolt. And I answered with the first thing that came into my
head:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"The thorns
are of no use at all. Flowers have thorns just for
spite!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class=
"italic">"Oh!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;There was a moment of complete
silence. Then the little prince flashed back at me, with a kind of
resentfulness:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I don't
believe you! Flowers are weak creatures. They are naive. They
reassure themselves as best they can. They believe that their
thorns are terrible weapons . . ."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I did not answer. At that instant
I was saying to myself: <span class="italic">"If this bolt still
won't turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer."</span>
Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"And you
actually believe that the flowers—"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Oh,
no!"</span> I cried. <span class="italic">"No, no, no! I don't
believe anything. I answered you with the first thing that came
into my head. Don't you see—I am very busy with matters of
consequence!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;He stared at me,
thunderstruck.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"Matters of
consequence!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;He looked at me there, with my
hammer in my hand, my fingers black with engine-grease, bending
down over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly . . .</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"You talk
just like the grown-ups!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;That made me a little ashamed.
But he went on, relentlessly:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"You mix
everything up together . . . You confuse everything . .
."</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;He was really very angry. He
tossed his golden curls in the breeze.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"I know a
planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman. He has never
smelled a flower. He has never looked at a star. He has never loved
any one. He has never done anything in his life but add up figures.
And all day he says over and over, just like you: 'I am busy with
matters of consequence!' And that makes him swell up with pride.
But he is not a man—he is a mushroom!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"A
what?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"A
mushroom!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The little prince was now white
with rage.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"The flowers
have been growing thorns for millions of years. For millions of
years the sheep have been eating them just the same. And is it not
a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to
so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use to them?
Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not important? Is
this not of more consequence than a fat red-faced gentleman's sums?
And if I know—I, myself—one flower which is unique in the world,
which grows nowhere but on my planet, but which one little sheep
can destroy in a single bite some morning, without even noticing
what he is doing—Oh! You think that is not important!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;His face turned from white to red
as he continued:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"If some one
loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the
millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just
to look at the stars. He can say to himself, 'Somewhere, my flower
is there . . .' But if the sheep eats the flower, in one moment all
his stars will be darkened . . . And you think that is not
important!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;He could not say anything more.
His words were choked by sobbing.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;The night had fallen. I had let
my tools drop from my hands. Of what moment now was my hammer, my
bolt, or thirst, or death? On one star, one planet, my planet, the
Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted. I took him in my
arms, and rocked him. I said to him:</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;<span class="italic">"The flower
that you love is not in danger. I will draw you a muzzle for your
sheep. I will draw you a railing to put around your flower. I
will—"</span></div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;I did not know what to say to
him. I felt awkward and blundering. I did not know how I could
reach him, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with
him once more.</div>
<div class="calibre8">&#160;&#160;It is such a secret place, the
land of tears.</div>
